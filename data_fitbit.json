            "review_text": "Update 12/8/15 - Fitbit just added a new firmware update for the sleep timer feature. Once updated it's no longer necessary to tap the Fitbit before going to sleep or when waking it. It will now recognize when you're inactive and have gone to sleep. It also has some new goal setting software in the app relating to sleep to make it easier to focus on getting more (or less) sleep. The graphic interface is pretty nice. I'm looking forward to using this since I've become something of a night owl and could really stand to get on a better schedule. One more thing to like about my Fitbit. The update took about 5 minutes using my iPad and plugging my Fitbit into its charger while it updated. The whole thing was simple. A red arrow on the dashboard, in the sync area alerted me to the upgrade. I really like this new feature. I bought 3 of these fitbit flex devices, one for myself, my husband and my sister. Before purchasing I researched several wristband devices such as the Jawbone UP, the Nike Fuel and and the Polar Loop. I also looked at the fitbit force which is a newer version of this band. The lack of water resistance on the force was a deal breaker for me. I wanted to be able to wear this band 24/7 and to be able to wear it in the shower or when swimming. That was part of what made it attractive to me. Also, after reading reviews about the clasp problems on the force and how many people lost them, I wanted no part of that. They are also quite a bit bigger and look clunckier. The wristband on the UP looked like it would catch on everything and had no display at all. The Polar had lots of quality problems. I wasn't crazy about the looks of the Nike. The display is nice and I can see how people would like them, but not my style. The fitbit flex, to my tastes, had the coolest look. I also know a couple of people who own the fitbit flex and they were very enthusiastic about them so that influenced me as well. So here is what I like about the flex: I like the way it looks on my wrist. All of us got the slate color. You can also order bands in a few different colors, both here and on the Fitbit site. It is lightweight and even though I don't often wear a watch I don't notice this on my wrist at all. The clasp was VERY difficult to secure the first couple of times until the rubber softened up a bit and until I got the hang of it. I secured it off of my wrist a couple times when it was new. Making sure the band and clasps are lined up correctly and then placing one finger directly below the clasp and my thumb directly above and squeezing hard was the way to do it. I like that it's water resistant and that I can wear it swimming or in the shower. It is safe down to 10 meters or around 30 feet. I like that the wristband is made of TPU rubber, which according to Wikipedia is a type of rubber used in automotive instrument panels, caster wheels, power tools, sporting goods, medical devices, drive belts, footwear, inflatable rafts, and a variety of extruded film, sheet and profile applications. I think it should hold up for a very long time. I like that the display on the band gives me a rough idea by tapping on it of my progress throughout the day. I can also check my progress on my iPhone 4S and see number of steps so far, calories burned, how many hours of sleep I got last night and how often I woke up or was restless. So far it seems very accurate. I can also track the foods I've eaten and the calories, my weight goals and weight lost, check on the weekly number of steps friend's with Fitbits have taken and compare them with my own. I like that I can wear it 24/7 and only have to take it off to charge it once every 7 days. It takes about 3 hours to charge with a USB thingie that comes with it. I use a wall adapter to charge it but could also use a USB port on my desktop or laptop computer. I've lost too many pedometers in the past by dropping them out of my pockets or forgetting about them and sending them through the washing machine, so the wristband seems like a much better option for me. I also like that I can connect wirelessly with my smartphone and with the little dongle included that goes into my desktop or laptop, can connect with those wirelessly as well. Software downloads for all of these are free. I'm also able to connect on my first gen Kindle HD 8.9 although I can't see where it's shown as a supported device so far. But it works with the Android fitbit software in the app store. The step measurements seem reasonably accurate. Waving my hand slowly won't register as a step. Waving wildly will. Driving in the car won't register but reaching around quickly in the car sometimes will. Typing on the computer or Kindle won't register. I've heard that swimming doesn't register either but you can input the time and activity on your phone or tablet. When I first got the flex I started the iPhone app and watched my steps register on my screen as I walked around the house. That, and watching my steps on the treadmill have shown it to be pretty accurate for me, although not perfect. I think that all pedometers have some inaccuracies. What I'm looking for is a comparative trend where I can tell how much exercise I'm getting. The accuracy is good enough for me. So I wake up in the morning, tap the wristband quickly a few times to tell it I'm awake. Then if I tap it twice I see one tiny blinking light, telling me I'm working on my first 2,000 steps. Later, when I've hit that mark and tap to check again, I'll see one solid light and the second one blinking. There are 5 lights total and each represents 2,000 steps (or 20% of my goal. I could set it up differently on my computer, using a different number of steps as my daily goal if I wanted to.) So I can see my approximate progress any time during the day. When I hit my goal of 10,000 steps the band vibrates and all the lights flash. That means you done good! I can set up to 8 silent vibrating alarms on this fltbit. I have one to wake me up on weekdays (you can specify which days) and one at 8:00 each night to remind me stop eating for the day. The vibration gets my attention and is effective at waking me up. I set the alarms on my computer or phone. At night when I'm in bed and ready to go to sleep I tap the wristband rapidly a few times, it vibrates briefly, and goes into the sleep mode until I wake it again in the morning. So am I happy that I purchased the Fitbits for myself and my family members? Yes I am. It motivates me to walk or run more. I can connect to other friends and family with Fitbits to see everyone's weekly step progress but what really motivates me is just competing against myself. I'll find myself parking in the back of the parking lots at stores to log those extra steps or walking around the store longer because it's a good way to add even more. When I haven't reached my goal at night, I'll sometimes walk around the house several times just to hit a number. Now that can't be all bad, can it? Update 1/12/14 - I'll keep updating this review with comments and observations as I use this device. I noticed that walking at a rapid pace is counted as \"active minutes\". Someone on a message board suggested adding a touch of lotion to the clasp if you're having trouble getting it to clasp when it's new. Update 1/16/14 - A full charge is lasting just a bit over 7 days. It takes about 3 hours to recharge it fully. Update 1/21/14 - Some people have complained about this band coming undone and losing it. I haven't had any problems with it at all, even when pulling tight coat and shirt sleeves over it, brushing my arm against things or the dog pulling on it once or twice. (I'm sure the dog could have pulled it off if I didn't stop him.) The other day I had the dog's leash wrapped around the wrist with the Fitbit and even with the dog pulling against the leash the fitbit stayed on. We walked this way a couple of miles before I noticed it and unwrapped the leash from my wrist. But even with all that agitation my fitbit stayed put. It has stayed on through enough that I'm not very concerned about losing it. I've only taken it off to charge it. I have the band snug enough that I can only put one finger beneath the band but I can move it a couple of inches back and forth on my wrist. Update 7/3/14 - A new update that works with iPhones that use the Fitbit app was released a few days ago. I've used it with my iPhone 4S and really like the new upgrade. It adds a whole new dimension to my Fitbit app. With the upgrade, I just click on the exercise icon on the dashboard which takes me to a new screen showing the days of the week that I've exercised. (Meaning a walk, run or hike, something in addition to the regular walking in my daily activities.) This screen shows exercise frequency by day of the week, it puts a check on the days that you do some planned exercise. If I click the little stopwatch in the upper right-hand corner, it takes me to a screen where I can click Walk, Run, or Hike. I go back and can then click Cues which takes me to another screen where I can select whether or not I want to hear spoken cues. I can also tell it which cues I want including: Distance, Time, Average Pace, Split Pace, and Calories Burned. Then I go back again an can select the frequency of the cues from every .5 miles to every 5 miles. Or, I can make the cues time based ranging from every 2 minutes, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 minutes. I can also select the volume of the cues. (Medium was perfect for me.) Then, back again to select a playlist from my iPhone's loaded tunes. Last, I allowed location services for Fitbit in my phone settings and I was ready to go. Now I see a big red circle with a Start arrow on the screen over a GPS map showing my location. I pop in my earphones, click Start and my music starts playing. As I walk, I can see a screen showing how far I've walked, rate per mile, time elapsed. Every half mile a voice interrupts my music telling me how far I've gone and all the other things I've specified in Cues that I wanted to know. Then it goes back to playing my music until it's time for my next designated Cue. How cool is that? It works seamlessly. At the end of my walk I tell it I'm finished (or I could also pause it if I stop to talk to a neighbor or something). When I'm finished (or even during the walk or run) I can see a little red line showing my route on the map. The steps from my walk are added to my steps count, just as they always are. I love these new features. They add a lot to the Fitbit experience. For those of you who track calories and foods eaten in the Fitbit app, the update now includes a bar code scanner. So far, the things I've scanned have been in their database. If you don't see the bar code symbol in the upper right-hand corner of the Log Food screen, log out of the Fitbit app and then log back in and it should be there. Update 11/28/14 - If something happened to ithis Fitbit today, what would I replace it with? Another one just like it. If one of the new Fitbit models was interchangeable with it on a daily basis I might get one of those too, just because I like new technology. But this one would be my main fitness band. I would like having a watch built in, but then it would look kind of silly wearing a conventional watch on the other arm. And I have a lot of nice watches. Update 12/12/14 - I just noticed today that the Fitbit Flex is the #1 Best Seller on Amazon this holiday season. It does seem like when I see people wearing fitness bracelets, this is the one they're most often wearing. A lot of the competitors have lowered prices significantly on their devices which is probably the best indicator of all. It's nice to know that I'm not the only Fitbit fan after wearing it for nearly a year. :) Update 12/26/14 - My Fitbit looks all new for the holidays. This replacement bracelet took over 20 days to arrive but for about $2 it was worth the wait. 1pc Small S Black with White Dots Spots Replacement Band With Clasp for Fitbit FLEX Only /No tracker/ Wireless Activity Bracelet Sport Wristband Fit Bit Flex Bracelet Sport Arm Band Armband A couple people have asked me how the bands hold up over time. I have to tell them that I don't know since I'm wearing different colored ones almost every day. They don't have much of a chance to show wear. After almost a year of wearing these 24/7, none of us have had one come off accidentally. Even the cheap knock-off bands seem sturdy and reliable like the original. And I'm not a very careful person about pulling tight sleeves over it or draping grocery bag handles over my arm. I have the steps across our back patio counted out by counting them myself. It is 60 steps back and forth once. (Yeah, I know, way too anal.) Oftentimes when I haven't hit my 10,000 steps for the day, I'll go out and walk back and forth with my iPad on the patio table to check my progress. I know from doing this that the Fitbit step count is dead-on accurate for counting steps when walking. Dancing will add steps which I think is fair since it's at least as good as walking for exercise. Update 1/30/15 - I can't believe I've had my Fitbit Flex for over a year already. I'm still wearing it 24/7 as a great motivator to keep moving. I've had several people email me with questions about the way it counts steps so I thought I'd share this with you. I tested another fitness band recently, wearing it on the same arm as the Fitbit. The other band recorded a lot more steps than the Fitbit. I've \"manually\" counted steps while walking around different areas around my house and compared them to the Fitbit and found them to be exactly the same. But I never did it for more than about 100 steps. Now I was curious because the readings on the two bands were so different. So I went for a walk and counted out 1,000 steps as I took them, counting in my head. (Mumbling under my breath, actually.) Before I started, I noted the starting number of steps on my iPhone for both bands using the apps for each. At the end, I checked the number of steps for both bands. The Fitbit recorded 1004 steps. The other band recorded 1,217. Only 4 extra steps on the Fitbit is pretty impressive and is close enough for me. I'm contacting the manufacturer of the other band to see why it's so far off. Several people didn't realize that you can adjust the stride for the Fitbit. Just log into the dashboard in your Fitbit app, click on the little gear thingy in the upper right hand corner and select \"Settings\". There's a field there for Stride Length and Running Stride Length. You can manually enter your personal stride length. If you leave these blank, the app will estimate the values based on your height and whether you are a man or woman. Click the \"Update Profile\" button to save your changes. Remember to sync to update your tracker with the new stride measurements. I didn't even realize I could do this until several months after I had my Fitbit. I guess it must have estimated correctly in my case because when I put it in manually I didn't notice a difference. Update 4/30/15 - Fitbit has an update that now allows you to track multiple Fitbit devices on your Fitbit app. I haven't tried this, but from what I understand this will allow you to go back and forth between other models and once registered it will recognize them automatically. It's tempting to try the Fitbit Charge or the Surge that can measure heart rate or pulse or have caller ID. They're bulkier than I would like to wear on an all-the-time basis, but would be nice for workouts. And new technology is always fun. The Flex is still my first love and I like the switchable bands, but I'll look at the new models now that it isn't an either/or decision. Here are their instructions for adding another Fitbit: Update your Fitbit app (if you haven\u2019t already) \u2018Set Up a New Fitbit Device\u2019 from the Account tab in the Fitbit mobile app or Fitbit Connect Finish the setup instructions, and start swapping \u2013 we\u2019ll take care of the rest! Update 5/7/15 - Has everyone seen the new Fitbit commercial? I usually fast forward through TV commercials on the DVR, but this one I recorded and kept until I could find it on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qVi_nF6y8 This makes me smile every time I watch it. Update 1/24/16 - When I purchased my Flex a little over 2 years ago it was advertised as being \"Water resistant to 10 meters or 33 feet\" which is 1 ATM. Their website now states: \"Flex has been tested up to 1 ATM meaning it is sweat, rain and splash proof. However, the device is not swim proof. We also recommend taking Flex off before showering because, as with any wearable device, it\u2019s best for your skin if the band stays dry and clean.\" The definition of 1 ATM, as I understand it is that it indicates that under static (nonmoving) conditions at 10 meters below the surface of the water the pressure of the water will not breach the seals on the device. But I can't take it into the shower? Perhaps even more confusing is the Fitbit Surge is rated at 5 ATM (50 meters) and has the same warning about not being swim proof and not to be worn in the shower. Are they just trying to ensure that users don't abuse the tracker? That said, I always shower with mine, I never dry it off afterward except the top when I'm drying my arms. I don't swim often but when I do, I leave it on. If I were going to spend a lot of time swimming on a regular basis I might take it off since it doesn't track swimming anyway. But for splashing around in a pool occasionally, I don't worry about it. My skin is somewhat sensitive to watch bands and I'm allergic to some metals and other materials. I couldn't be much LESS careful about the Fitbit and have never had a problem with the band and my skin. The underside is often damp from getting wet in the shower even half an hour later and it hasn't bothered my wrist. Being able to wear this 24/7 was a major selling point for me and it has worked just fine since January 2014.",

            "review_header": "Jawbone UP vs Fitbit Flex -- Fight!", 
            "review_text": "Several asked my opinion of the Flex after I had compared UP to ONE last fall. I'm more pleased with Flex than expected. This review will be specifically for those comparing the Jawbone UP to the Fitbit Flex. For those interested in my review of the One and Jawbone UP it is located here: UP by Jawbone - Large Wristband - Retail Packaging - Onyx : --------------------- UPDATE: I uploaded several head-to-head app screenshots. UPDATE: I've found that I am storing quite a bit of water in the Flex band pouch where the module goes. Even though they say it's shower safe, I'm pretty sure some funky stuff is going to be growing in there in a matter of time... But the band is replaceable! --------------------- My journey with personal monitoring devices/pedometers started a LONG time ago: Before Fitbit even existed, with a device called the SportBrain. It was a traditional belt clip style so old that it plugged into a base that used a dial in phone modem to upload the usage data to a server. It was old. But my interest in devices that can help monitor and tell me about my activity started then, and we seem to be now in a golden age of personal data monitoring devices. Fitbit Flex, Jawbone UP, all of the Fitbit clip devices and so many more... Hardware itself The biggest drawbacks I found on the Jawbone UP were that it had no visual feedback about your daily achievement toward your goal and the fact that it had no visual battery indicator. It wasn't a problem for me personally, but for those who are hardcore driven on a daily basis to compare and achieve this could be a drawback for you. The next drawback about the Jawbone UP is that it does not wirelessly sync. You have to plug it into the headset jack of your phone to sync. If you are someone who wants data and feedback all day long, this would be a drawback. The Fitbit Flex does have visual feedback in the form of small white lights: They blink as you're charging, they have a special blink if you put it into sleep mode and provide 95% more feedback than Jawbone up. Jawbone UP does have status lights in it and they are used, but they could do a lot more with the lights they already have if they chose to. If you can throw a snap bracelet on, you can easily put on the UP. I did find myself fumbling a bit with the clip mechanism of the Flex like I do when I have to button my own shirt cuffs. After it was clipped though, it feels secure and I am not one to put on and remove devices like this. I want to set it and forget it. Fit & Feel The Fitbit Flex feels very comfortable on the wrist. The pictures don't do it justice. For me personally this is the one defining factor that really makes the Flex shine for me compared to the Jawbone UP. It feels super light weight, doesn't grab, and doesn't look nearly as big/thick as the pictures make it look. The UP uses tension to stay on, while the Flex uses a clasp. The UP may have a better sense of solid attachment that wouldn't come off no matter how hard you fling your arm, but the inverse of that is the Flex: It doesn't have to monkey-grip your arm to be there and stay. You can have it fit a bit more loosely than UP and be comfortable. When typing on at a keyboard, I prefer the feel of the Flex. The rubber is flat and thin so it adds very little against the edge of a keyboard. The UP doesn't have the big square bump on the top, but it does have a bracelet shape/size all the way around, so it can prove a bit more of an annoyance up against a keyboard. The Flex does have replaceable bracelets and colors, which means the device is more convertible and flexible going forward. That being said, it is less visually appealing to me compared to the UP. The UP can be a part of jewelry and most people would never notice. The Flex does have a strange-ish future nerd look to it. I don't mind that, but some may. I wear both in the shower with no issues. I've done a lot of swimming pool roughhousing with the UP with no issues, but haven't tried with the FLEX. A commenter tells me that it is swimming approved, though the data provided might not be that useful. Battery Life & Charging Both the Flex and the UP charge in very similar almost identical USB adapters. They're meant to be charged on a computer and in my experience shouldn't be charged off of a phone USB wall charger. They both charged in similar amounts of time, and the Flex did last about 4 days on a charge. The UP can last as much as 10 days on a new battery, but I found that it has declined some since November. On this case, I say that both do about what they suggest. The UP fits snugly in the charger, while the Flex doesn't feel nearly as secure in its charger but I haven't had any issues with it falling out. Syncing: The Jawbone UP sync's via the headphone jack of the phone. It doesn't do Bluetooth, can't be plugged into a PC, so you're pretty much set on a smart phone or table to sync it. It's simple, doesn't consume battery to sync wirelessly, and works reliably. You have to watch because not all phones are supported. The Flex syncs wirelessly with Bluetooth 4.0 via the smartphone or via an adapter to a computer. For those without a smart phone or a locked down phone that work doesn't allow you to install apps, this could be a deal maker for you. It's not a constant sync but initiates as soon as you open the app on the smartphone. I haven't noticed any significant battery life loss. Not all phones are supported with Bluetooth 4.0-- most phones on the market don't yet have Bluetooth 4.0. You'll want to check Fitbit's website to see if your phone is supported. On the upside, the Flex does come with a Bluetooth adapter you can plug into a PC or Mac to sync wirelessly via the computer. It really adds extra work and decreases the usefulness of wireless sync, but it's do-able. Software: The software, to me, is the major differentiating factor between the two devices. The hardware looks entirely different, and there are some small differences in what the hardware can do, but the delivery through the app is what makes them clearly meant for different targets. The Jawbone UP software is beautiful. After you've sync'd enough it starts giving you feedback and encouragement through statistics. It will tell you \"you were in the top 15% of UPpers this week\" or \"getting 8 hours of sleep per night it shown to improve....\" if your sleep is coming up short. It does have the option to add in food consumption, performs a variety of tasks such as calibrating it's readings with actual distance walked, and has a really interesting \"lifeline\" feature that trends your activity & sleep over a period of hours, days, weeks and you can create a report on the fly comparing, for example, sleeping and calorie intake, to see if you consume more calories on days that you didn't have adequate sleep. It shows trends on daily/weekly and true to the marketing is a more \"holistic\" view of you and your life/activity. I guess we have reached my thesis for the comparison: Jawbone UP is about the holistic view of your life, while the Fitbit Flex is more finely focused on activity, seeing feedback for that activity in a quick frequent way and focusing on providing you that core data quickly and simply. The Fitbit software is the same software in use for all current Fibit devices. As soon as you launch it, a sync begins and your latest data will be presented. While the UP presents more current data on the \"HOME\" page, Fitbit has other tabs where you can explore the data they present. UPDATE: I discovered that the Fitbit software does do single activity trending if you turn the phone sideways: Hours/days/weeks, etc. It doesn't compare it to another statistic, but better than nothing. Both devices sync your data to a website. The Flex presents a more insightful view of your data on the website, while UP presents an equal amount of that data on the mobile app. Both support third party apps if you are really intense about a specific subject ( like food/calories with extensive catalogues, MyFitnessPal, etc.) A few features that the Flex has that the UP does not: -Lighted feedback on the band -more flexible fit, colors that can be changed after purchase -Thinner band around places you may bump against desks, etc. -wireless syncing (Jawbone needs to get on this train) -quick access in the app to 'water consumed' Fitbit Flex: Less expensive, simple quick device for activity & sleep tracking and wireless syncing from a company that is widely known for pedometers. A few features that UP has that Flex does not: -insight engine to look at your data and provide you feedback -longer maximum battery life -inactivity alarm. Fitbit could easily issue this in an update. I love this feature on the UP -bar code scanner in the food app to scan premade food for nutrition contents -power nap which will auto wake you between 25-45 minutes by modeling after your normal short sleep cycle Jawbone UP: Technology that could pass for fashion. A fantastic app with a holistic view on your life, sleep and wellness. Both devices are good devices and had no fatal flaws. Both devices offer communities and ability to add friends to provide encouragement and interaction. If I had to give an elevator speech about the difference between the two: 1. A few tech differences: Flex has wireless sync and quick feedback throughout the day. Flex is thick on top, and thin around. UP is more consistent without a clasp. 2. UP has a very useful insight engine and is more of a \"holistic\" view. Less rewarding for someone who wants instant feedback. It's all about your time horizon: If you want to look at days and weeks of data, receive valuable feedback about your activity and sleep patterns and wellness the UP will probably please you most. If you are someone who wants hourly motivation and ability to sync frequently then the Flex is probably the right device for you. I hope this comparison has been helpful. If you have any specific questions I will be happy to answer or investigate & answer. My personal lean is toward the UP simply because I am using it to observe my sleep and activity from a bigger picture view. Sometimes I may go a day or few before I sync. If I were in a mode for physical fitness or weight loss, I may probably prefer the Flex. It all depends on your objective. There really isn't a fight between these devices-- they're both good and are focused towards different crowds. UPDATE: I found an interesting quirk with Flex: I was shopping at a store today and the shopping cart had a wheel that was a little bumpy. During my shopping I felt a vibration from Flex and thought maybe I had made a part of my daily goal. Then: BZZ, BZZ, BZZ! Turns out that the bumping of the cart in a rhythmic way confused the Flex into thinking I tapped it. It kept going in and out of sleep mode. Whoops. I can't wait until I see today's data....",

            "review_header": "Why does this now have over 4 THOUSAND negative reviews?", 
            "review_text": "The Flex is fairly good - IF you understand its limitations. And it has a lot of them. This is a 1.0 version, the first wrist-based tracker Fitbit has produced. There are good reasons why there are so many negative reviews of the Flex. I strongly suggest that you wait for the technology to be refined by Fitbit (and others) before spending $100 or more on this. I also suggest that you tune out the 5-star \"this is AWESOME!\" reviewers. I've had the Flex for 6 months now (acquired at CES 2013, long before retail availability) and initially I too was impressed by the technology. However, with long-term use, I think its inaccuracies make it nothing more than a pedometer with sleep analysis added in (and the usefulness of the latter is dubious as well). The IDEA of it all is excellent: to track your activities and see your progress over time via the great software that Fitbit has developed. However, all of this is predicated on the device accurately tracking your movements. If it fails in that aspect - and unfortunately it does, to a moderate degree - then all of the data and impressive charts and graphs are rather useless. The \"awesome!\" reviewers don't realize this (yet) and just assume what they're seeing is real; it isn't. The underlying technological problem, as I see it, is in the placement of the tracker. Up until now, Fitbit trackers were to be placed on the torso. Now, it must be placed on the wrist (yes, the tracker itself can be taken out of the wristband and put into your pocket but all of Fitbit's calibrations and algorithms are designed for that wrist placement and you are making the problem worse by not having it on your wrist). So, if your wrist movement is ANYTHING other than the usual movement of either running or walking, your step count/mileage is going to be off - often way, way off. Fitbit markets the Flex as an \"activity monitor\", implying that it is capable of keeping stats on your physical activities. Well, because of the wrist location issue and the basic design structure of using two stride lengths for all calculations (your walking and running stride lengths), pretty much any activity that is NOT walking or running cannot be accurately monitored: the accelerometer senses whether you are walking or running and multiplies the appropriate stride length by the number of steps sensed (and arrives at a mileage distance). Any activity outside of that limited ability of the Flex, your stats are innacurate. This includes stair-climbing, hiking, tennis, golf, biking, working out, and pretty much every other \"activity\" that is not walking or running. The Flex is not really an \"activity monitor\"; it's an expensive pedometer (albeit one with \"sleep analysis\", which is actually only a record of how much wrist movement you had during the night: i.e., 2 hours of no movement = deep sleep, an hour of sporadic movement = restless sleep). There are, however, aspects of the Flex that are quite good: it does accurately keep track of your walking and running, it does keep track of your sleeping patterns, and it also wakes you with a silent vibration on your wrist at the time you set to get up in the morning. And once out of bed and into the shower, there's no need to take the Flex off: it's almost completely waterproof (pressurized water being the exception). But the best, perhaps life-enhancing aspect of the Flex is its ability to keep you focused on your exercise goals (which is the main reason why, overall, I like the device and its software - to a point): if you DO consider it only a pedometer with cool software, which is what I consider it to be, you will not be disappointed (though the price may not seem worth it to others). First, there's the 'onboard' function to keep you aware of your progress towards your daily goals (total distance traveled, number of steps taken, or calories burned): each light on the row of 5 small LED lights on the band represents 20% of your goal and a quick glance and a tap on the band will tell you how you're doing. Secondly, for the actual stats of your progress (or reviewing your daily, weekly or longer stats), you can view them in real time on your phone via the Fitbit App for iPhone and Android, or on your tablet or PC/Mac with the Fitbit 'Dashboard'. This is where you set your daily and longer-term goals, view not only your stats but see them represented in charts and graphs, and log other information such as weight, weight changes, and food consumed. You can go further, but personally I would feel a bit silly setting goals where I would receive 'badges' for reaching them. But that's just me. Overall though, the software is very good and keeps you aware - along with the band's LEDs - of whether or not you are staying on track of exercise goals. But, again, just keep in mind that the wrist placement of the device gives the Flex an inherent flaw as to the accuracy of all this data - UNLESS you are using it only to monitor and analyze walking and running stats, as I do. If you're like me and the term \"highly-motivated\" (or \"disciplined\") and your name rarely appear in the same sentence, the Flex is a great help in that regard: it makes you keenly aware of whether you're succeeding or failing in your exercise regimen, which I find to be a great help in discipline and motivation. The Flex is a good motivator because you do not want to have today's exercise stats look inferior to yesterday's - or this week's less than last week's - or this month's less than last month's: you can graphically SEE all this on a color graph, your success or failure staring you right in the face. And who wants to stare at his or her failure or laziness? We want to see improvement, to see success. And, for me, this is why the Flex is a valuable tool: an ever-present motivator. I personally use it for running and I find that I really push myself to prevent the present week's stats (total mileage, etc.) from failing to outdo last week's. Seeing the charts and color graphs of several months of steady progress, there's a real feeling of accomplishment and a strong motivation to continue. It is this visual presentation of your exercise efforts that sets the Flex (and other Fitbit models) apart, in my opinion. Is the Flex a miracle device that will accurately detail your every movement, every calorie burned, throughout your day? No, it's an accelerometer/pedometer based on your stride lengths and your wrist movement; there are many activities where it is impossible for such a device to determine steps, etc. Fitbit's marketing of the device was overblown, calling the Flex an \"activity monitor/tracker\", implying - to many - that all activities could be measured for steps/mileage/calories, which is not the case. Further, Fitbit should not be marketing it as a calorie monitor because an accelerometer alone (which is what the Flex is) cannot possibly count calories burned with any real accuracy. So, overall, I would give the Flex 2 stars, based on the way it's marketed to the general public. It does fail to live up to many buyers' expectations (read the many 1- and 2-star raging reviews). The technology required to do what Fitbit infers the Flex can do - tracking and monitoring most physical activities - is probably a few years away. Someday there may be a Flex with integrated GPS, heart-rate monitor and an accurate altimeter: THEN we can expect steps/mileage/calories counts to be done for many more activities. For now, this Flex (\"Flex 1.0\") is basically a pedometer (with a few other features) and its accuracy is limited to a narrow range of activity. My personal needs happen to fall into that narrow range: I use it only for running and walking exercise and in analyzing, graphically, my fitness history and progress via the Dashboard, and it's a great motivational tool. For my personal needs, I'd probably have to give it 3 stars (but this would be misleading to the average Amazon buyer). Unless your personal needs are as narrow as mine, I would hold off on buying the Flex until improvements are made. You can duplicate this model's limited abilities with a decent pedometer and freeware/shareware to manually input and analyze the stats. ---------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE There have been so many good questions about aspects of the Flex that I didn't cover originally that it's probably best that I expand the review: LOCATION OF TRACKER: Early questions asked about whether or not you can wear the tracker outside of the band or with the band around your ankle, etc. (earlier Fitbits could be worn anywhere on the torso). It is only accurate on your wrist (or, rather, it is most accurate on your wrist, its overall accuracy pretty questionable). ACCURACY OVERALL: For usual activities like walking and running, if you see inaccuracies in mileage or number of steps, probably your stride measurements are not like the average person for your height (which is what Fitbit uses for default strides, your height entered when you set up your account). In your account settings, you can change 'Stride Length' and 'Running Stride Length' in order to calibrate the accuracy. Ignore the reviewer who states that you can't calibrate the Flex: you can; all the tracker is doing is counting steps (and multiplying those steps for mileage amounts); since you can adjust your stride lengths, you can calibrate the Flex to your exact needs. The device has a walking step (stride) and a running step and counts them (and converts your steps to mileage). The only way to have accurate mileage is for the Flex to KNOW your two stride distances and to have the wrist tracker sense whether you're walking or running; if you mess with those dynamics (irregular steps, irregular wrist movement), you mess with accuracy, simple as that. There is an additional tweak to minimize wrist movement inaccuracies: you CAN go into your dashboard settings and change the location of the wristband from 'dominate hand' to 'non-dominate', but I've found that this to be of little use: the Flex is only reliable when walking and running AND having normal wrist activity while doing so. Instances where one wrist is more active than the other are not likely to be in walking and running activities. WATERPROOF: It is not entirely waterproof. You can wear it in the shower or along the surface of a pool. However, it's not rated to withstand water at depth - water where there's pressure. STAIRS: Unlike its predecessors like the One, the Flex does not have an altimeter and therefore cannot count stairs climbed. From what I read, Fitbit did away with it because it was inherently inaccurate. BANDS: The Flex comes with both a small and a large band. The large band goes from about 6 1/4\" to 8 1/4\" and the small, 5 1/2\" to almost 7\" and both are fully adjustable between those lengths. Putting on the band is difficult the first week or so - the rubber is a bit stiff - but then it becomes looser and easier to put on. TREADMILLS: Your 'Running Stride Length' on a treadmill may be shorter than on the road (no forward momentum). See above about tweaking stride lengths. HEART RATE: No, there is no heart rate monitor. CALORIE COUNTS: The Flex really should NOT be marketed as a calorie-burning monitor. No device without a heart-rate monitor can accurately determine calorie burning. But when using the Flex to simply analyze a run or a long walk, it can 'ballpark' calories burned fairly well; expecting it to tell you how many calories you burned in the past 24 hours - not so much. SUBSCRIPTION: For your normal account there is no additional charge for anything but for a 'Premium Account', which gives additional analysis and tips (such as a 'Fitbit Trainer' 12-week plan, more data analysis, a 'peer ranking', etc.), it is $49.95 per year. The Premium doesn't really seem worth it, to me, but then again it's only $4 a month or so for someone who wants to get more from the Flex. SLEEP MODE: There are two options for sleep mode. One is automatic and does not require you to \"tell\" the Flex that you are going to sleep, like the Up and and other competing models; however, you do need to log your sleep hours on your dashboard; at the next sync your sleep data will be visible. Alternatively you can fast tap the band when going to bed and do the same when you wake up. Personally, I prefer the dashboard method as I would probably forget quite often to tap the band. The Flex determines amounts of restful vs. wakeful/restless sleep simply by wrist movement (i.e., no movement for 2 hours = restful sleep). The novelty of being able to analyze your sleep patterns soon wears off, at least in my case; the usefulness of the data seems questionable. ANDROID COMPATIBILITY: You need Bluetooth 4 for real time syncing. CHARGING: It takes about 2 hours to fully charge using the dedicated USB cord. The battery lasts about a week. OVERALL OPINION: I did use the thing for months: it kept me motivated by being able to compare walking and running stats over time via the software interface. Otherwise, it was no better than a decent pedometer (and triple the cost). It fell apart after 3 months, like it seems to do quite commonly. Remember that this is the 1.0 version of the Flex, so enhanced capabilities - and better quality overall - may not be too far away. Perhaps the Flex 2.0 will be worth the list price if improvements are made but this 1.0 version is really not be worth it for most people. Read the many 1- and 2-star reviews as evidence of this. And, again, do not trust the mountain of 5-star reviews: if you look at them, 90% are 5 words or less ('Love my Fitbit!'), written by people who have no idea as to whether all the shiny color graphs and step counts are accurate or not. They are not, for reasons explained above.",

After having a sleep test and getting a cpap machine I continued to map my sleep. The Fitbit was amazingly accurate with my cpap, showing the same amount of sleep. As I have slept more with the machine, the Fitbit has reflected more hours. You can see in the photos how much difference my sleep was with the cpap. I love the 'friends' feature. It helps me to see how much I need to walk and what the average steps my friends are taking. My only regret is not getting the more expensive version. I am a nurse and would love to have the watch feature. I also bought several replacement bands to match with my different outfits.

            "review_text": "I have had my Fitbit Flex for about a year and a half. It has really enabled me to become more active. Last June I finally decided I needed to get in shape and lose the extra 40 pounds that I have been carrying around for the past three years. Using the Fitbit to give me an accounting of my steps, the Lose it! app to keep me accountable for my caloric intake, and finding a form of exercise that was fun for me (Just Dance video games) were the key for me in losing the weight. The combination of all three enabled me to lose the 40 pounds in five months and I have continued to use them in maintaining which I have done now for nine and a half months. Back to the Fitbit Flex, I downloaded the app on my phone and also keep track on my computer. I like that you can track not only your steps but also your sleep patterns, water intake, and caloric intake. Luckily for me the Fitbit syncs with the Lose it! app so all the information I put in gets transferred between the apps. I like that you can join in challenges with friends and that you get a little pat on the back in the form of a vibration when you reach your goal each day. I thought seriously about upgrading to the Fitbit Charge but decided against it because I like that I can change the color and look of my band with the Fitbit Flex to coordinate with my outfit or my mood for the day. Another thing that I really like about the Fitbit Flex is the fact that I can set an alarm. I hate waking up to the sounds of beep-beep-beep...beep-beep-beep, you get the idea. With the Fitbit Flex I can set an alarm to wake up in the morning and instead of waking up in a startling manner, I get a light vibration on my wrist which is a much nicer way to wake up in my opinion. I love the Fitbit Flex and am very thankful for this product. It has helped me to become more active.",

So, don't buy this thing. I've already also had it not log steps, and you can't even delete your own account, you have to ask THEM to do it for you, and then they require you to go through multiple layers of lengthy menus just to be able to email them. I wish I had just gone with the apple watch. You get what you pay for. I've had to go through all these hassles, after just owning it for a mere 6 weeks. edited to add: the support forum doesn't allow you to post anything but positive posts in their forum.

At first I was happy with the information it provided, sleek look and the motivation it gave me to exercise more. I wore it less than a month when I decided to buy another one from Amazon for a gift to a friend. After walking and hiking for hours it was fun to see our results. We quickly found out that our Fitbits were not accurately adding every step. We found that odd since we have the same body size, strides are the same and we walk in unison. (Yes, military style) Or maybe adding too many 'steps' ... this happens when you move your Fitbit hand up and down (like a drummer). It counts arm movements as steps! It is poorly designed, uncomfortable on the wrist bone and the wristband rubber broke apart within a couple of months of purchasing it. You have to pull the small battery from the inside of the wristband to charge it. After repeatedly taking the battery in and out, the rubber broke. Four of my friends with this Fitbit had the same problem. The rubber breaking is a very common problem. Perhaps that is why there are two wristbands in the box with the Fitbit. One is larger than the other. When I'm out and about and see someone with a Fitbit on I ask them what they think of it. Their answers are basically the same problems I've listed here.",

I am a waitress and hostess for a restaurant, so I know generally how much I'm moving around. It's definitely not 5 miles lol. With pedometers, I have gotten around 3 miles in my restaurant in a night. So that's frustrating, especially because a pedometer costs 5$ and this costs 100$ . The only thing I actually really like about this thing is the fact that it gets people motivated to exercise, which, lets face it- America really needs. One of the best (and only) features it offers besides being a glorified inaccurate pedometer is the ability to have a silent alarm. Really cool, and perhaps the only reason I would get one. My boyfriend and I have different schedules and this allows him to sleep while I go to school or vice versa. So if you need a silent alarm (buzzes on your arm instead of being a loud obnoxious ring tone) then get this. Otherwise, not so much. Hope this helped, especially because there is so much hype around these devices lately. Here is it what it really does.

We are in a time where smart devices are literally taking over our lives and many new smart watches are being released every few months. But, I always wondered how such a simple device can be just as popular, if not more, than the upcoming smart watches. Especially considering all this thing does is keep track of your fitness, which is technically something any other smart watch can do. You see, the point to understand here, is what this watch does, it does very very well. It takes personal fitness to another level. This is a company that focuses on making wearable\u2019s targeted towards fitness, and that\u2019s where it excels. Many companies have tried to compete and will try to compete, but it\u2019s not going to beat the simplicity that comes with Fitbit! That\u2019s the most important aspect. It\u2019s simple. For everyone that\u2019s looking for a way to improve their fitness, they don\u2019t need something high tech with cameras, sensors, and touch screens. At the end of the day, how much are going to actually use those things. This product does the job in a very simple and easy to use functionality. This is perfect for the parents, the grandparents and everyone that wants something to the point. Furthermore, Fitbit has made a social network out of this one device. You see your friend ran 6000 steps today, you\u2019re going to be inclined to beat them. Competition is inherent within all of us. Making fitness a friendly competition among friends, just makes it easier for all of us. Next time you go to the mall, maybe you won\u2019t mind parking all the way in the back, because you gotta get in those 100 more steps to beat your friends. You can even create groups within companies and see who\u2019s being the most active, fostering more active work environment with healthier employees. Lastly, simplicity, it has a simple wrist band look. It even vibrates and flashes when you reach your goal. This is a sign of encouragement, and something that will only make you work harder. It\u2019s also water resistant, so you can freely wear it in the shower. Keep in mind water resistant is not the same as water proof. I wouldn\u2019t recommend going scuba diving with a fitbit just to get in a few extra steps. Also, something cool about it, that you may not know is it even tracks your sleep! The way this works is through your movement. When you haven\u2019t moved in over an hour, it will assume that you are sleeping and morning movement tells your tracker that you\u2019re awake. This will give you an idea of how much you\u2019ve been sleeping and make sure you sleep the amount you should. My review here is meant to give you an idea of what the watch is for. I\u2019m not going to delve into specifics with usage, because you\u2019ll found 100s of other reviews below with the same information. The user interface is quite nice on android phones that I use it with. Of course, there are going to be kinks, but that\u2019s where updates come in. Fitbit has been regularly updating the app to make the user experience better. At the end of the day, that\u2019s the most important part. You\u2019re buying a fitness accessory from a company that only specializes in fitness accessories. So, it\u2019s going to improve in that area the most, most efficiently and effectively. If you found the above helpful, please leave a helpful thanks below. Thanks and hope it helped!",

This would have been nice, I often find myself looking at it trying to find the time only to realize it doesn\u2019t have a clock feature. -It cannot record other physical actives very well such as biking, cycling, cardio fitness, canoeing/kayaking, stairs, weight training or yoga. It is mainly for walking and hiking. It can detect movement and it can tell when you are being active and for how long but if you are not walking it may or may not record any data. -It does not have a heart rate monitor feature, lacking this feature might be a deal breaker for some -This device says it is water proof and I have taken a shower with it on before but a small amount of water will get into the band. Getting it wet won\u2019t cause any damage, but I like to dry it off after getting it wet. So if you get wet with it on plan on taking it off and letting it dry out afterwards. -The wrist band seems to crack after a few months. The crack continues to spread and grow, until you are worried about the device falling out of the band. The crack happens every time for me right around the area where the device slides in and out, which sits on your wrist when you put the band on. I am always paranoid about losing the device when it is cracked, so to be on the safe side every 3 months or so plan on spending 7-10 bucks on a replacement band. This is a little disappointing! I feel like this problem could be fixed with a better band design or a higher quality material for the band. I guess if not being able to see the light feature was a big deal you could maybe use some duct tape, I haven\u2019t experimented with the duct tape yet, but I have tried super glue which made the plastic band brittle and the crack grew much bigger and at faster rate -so take my advice and avoid superglue as a possible fix option. -Sometimes when I walk with my arms full of boxes it has a harder time detecting my movement/steps. There are times I have noticed the accuracy of this device may not be 100%. So if dead on accuracy is an issue for you this may not be the device for you Pros: -This device is defiantly better in my opinion that using a walking app on your phone or using a pedometer that you have to clip to your belt or bra strap. You can wear it like a watch and not worry about taking it off or on like a clip on pedometer. I have used clip on pedometers before and left them clipped to my pants and thrown them in the washer accidentally. Which this device at least I know when it is own my wrist. I leave it on most of the time and only take it off to shower and recharge. It is comfortable enough to sleep in. -The battery life lasts about a week for me, I use an alarm feature 5 days a week. The alarm lightly pulses a vibration on your wrist. I also love the usb charger, makes plugging it in while I am working my computer easy to maintain battery life. It takes about 1.5-2 hours to charge once a week. -The sleep tracking feature is pretty cool and has helped me improve my sleep quality -In some ways I love the simplicity of this device. It may not have as many features or bells and whistles, but it does give you a better idea of how much you are walking or a time table for how long you have been inactive. It also allows you to try to gradually increase your physical fitness goals, so this might be a good beginner device for a lot of folks. I have a desk job so being able to see when I have been inactive too long is helpful to me. It lets me visually see, oh I need to get up and move around for a little while or go for a walk on my lunch break; or go for a 10 minute walk every 4 hours. -The online support & account and features are great! You can set the alarm online, you can track your weight loss progress and create a custom weight loss goals for yourself, which will create a custom walking step guide to help you meet your goals. You can also track your meals, water intake and weight loss. A few of my coworkers go them so we have friendly office competitions with each other. Everyone is at a different level of fitness and has different fitness goals. If you are a little more hard core with your fitness and want to track your heart rate level throughout your workout this device may not be for you. Overall not bad for the beginners, there are always pros and cons for any device but I feel like this a great device for beginners and much easier to use than a pedometer you have clip to your belt. It has helped me be more consciences of my personal fitness, remember to be more active throughout the day, and helped me set and meet some goals. It has also helped me to improve the quality of my sleep. I would give 5 stars except for this two features I wish they would improve: 1- the wrist band cracking problem 2-adding a clock feature. I know there are 3rd party companies that such as Tory Burch who has started making metal wrist bands for $195. Spending an extra $200 on a band seems excessive I feel like Fitbit should have their own version of alternative band designs for a lower price.",

            "review_text": "There is a lot to like about he Fitbit Flex. It is light weight and comfortable. There is a lot packed into this small unit. Easy to set up and keeps a really accurate (to my experience) track of sleep and steps. Daily syncing is a breeze as the Flex is able to connect with its dongle throughout the house. Paired with the free apps and, if one were to actually use, the Fitbit Dashboard on the website, I think that this technology would have been a real benefit to me. I say would have because I had a major flaw with mine - the clasp on the band. The metallic clasp, that is supposed to secure the band and the Flex to the wrist, has two small(ish) prongs that are pressed through slots on both ends of the band and are to hold it in place. However, the clasp on mine was not very secure. Today, I looked down and the Flex was gone. It being so comfortable, I did not notice that it had fallen off. I will say that it may have just been my fault, but, with something in this price range, I made sure that I pressed down on the clasp each and every time I put it on a left the house. For that reason, I cannot recommend the Flex; at least not because of the potential, easy loss of your investment. A bad band? My fault that that the clasp did not fully engage? Either way, the clasp should be a bit more secure, even with butter fingers. If yours works great, congrats. If you are considering purchasing, just be aware of that the clasp may not be fully secure. Thanks",

            "review_text": "I'm so happy I purchased this. I have it in the color teal, which I LOVE. It did take me a couple days to get used to wearing it all the time, since I never wear bracelets or anything on my wrist, but now I don't even notice it. In terms of putting it on, it did take me a while to get the hang of fastening it but now I have it down pat. While I haven't seen it counting more steps than I actually did, I have noticed that sometimes it says I've been asleep longer then I know I actually was. But thats the only negative I can think of. It's amazing how obsessive it is- in terms of looking up sleep quality and your step count, and so far I can say its definitely made me put more effort into being active! Where before I would spend more time sitting down reading or watching TV, if I look at the ap and see that my step count is low, I will purposely get up and walk around. I also think having 'friends' on fitbit is a great idea, because that definitely motivates you to keep going- my coworkers and I certainly get competitive to see how many steps we can do in a 12 hour shift. I've owned this for almost a year now and I still wear it everyday and try to be more active everyday because of it. Unlike others, I haven't had any issues with it that I couldn't fix by resetting. Definitely a worthwhile purchase",

            "review_header": "good product if you understand its limitation", 
            "review_text": "At a glance- good value, good motivation, function is limited but great product if make good use of it. Detail- I was doing research on smart watch/sport wear. At first I didn't consider flex at all as it doesn't monitor my heart rate. However, I received this as a gift and decided to try it out. Features flex offers: Activity track- it only tracks your step count automatically. Like how many steps you've walk every day. It does mistake my driving as step as I raise my hands when I drive. It doesn't count any step if you don't move your hands when you walk. You can track your exercise using GPS but you need to start it with your app before the exercise. Other than the mentioned activities, you need to manually enter other exercise you did, like weightlifting or biking. You can input the calories burned by doing those activities but its not automatic and you have pretty much no way to find out exactly how much you burned. I'm surprise it does record my dog walking as active minutes instead of normal walking. I walk a little faster and longer when I walk my dogs compare to normal daily errand walks food & drink log- you have to manually input how much you eat and drink, of course. It calculates calories intake and compare it to the calories you burned Goal setting- it let you set how much you want to walk, in steps and distance , and you can keep track of your progress by tapping the band twice. It shows one dot for every 20% you've done. You can enter a weight you want to achieve and it tells you how much you are away from it. You need to manually enter your weight every time unless you have the aria scale which connects to your app. Sleep pattern- you have to tap the band for a few seconds to put it in sleep mode before you sleep. I found it pretty accurate in tracking my awake hours and restless times at night. Basically it tracks your sleep pattern by tracking your hand movement. The more tou I've, the more restless you are. When you wake up, you tap the band again and put it back to normal mode. Its quite annoying you have to put it in sleep mode every night but as long as you remember yo do it, it works great. Friend connection- you can connect with your friend and compete with each other. Its relatively easy and you can decide what info you want to share on their website, you can't set your privacy level within the app tho. Overall, I like the fitbit flex more than I expected. Like I said, I didn't even put flex into my consideration because its limited function. But after using it for a while, it does motivate me to walk more, eat better, drink more water and let me understand my sleep pattern. Bottom line, this is one of the relatively cheaper sport wear available in the market. Understand its limitation and make good use of it. Most of the things require manual input using the app. Use the app, record everything and you will be motivated. If you are lazy with all the info entering then no smartware in the world can satisfy you because what you ate won't magically appear in your app. A side note about amazon: I got another flex for my friend after I found it useful, got it for 98$ on amazon and the price dropped to 79$ a week after, on amazon or any store available. I contacted azon and they were super cool with refunding the difference to me. No hassles at all, that's why I'm a loyal amazon shopper",

Down 5 pounds toward my goal weight!!!!! Get moving! : ) 1 WEEK TODAY!!!! I am in LOVE with this Fitbit. I had wondered why I was gaining weight. . .easy answer. . .I eat more than I move! Now, this may seem a no brainer. . .but with an office job, I did not realize how much I was not moving and what poor choices of food I was choosing to eat quickly. This fitbit is a motivator for me. . .constant reminder to get up and move. . .to make smarter choices with my food. I like that it encourages me to compete with me for my physical well being. And, I can now connect to my friends on FB who are also Fitbit addicts. . .I have nothing negative to say about this. The band is comfortable. . .when you put it on listen for the clicks and it is secure. . .my band has not fallen loose much less fallen off. . .secure all day. I love Fitbit! *********Weekend update: I found I do not have to set my flex for when I am about to sleep, it monitors it on its own. ' I was pleasantly surprised about how much I walked just during everyday cleaning, but was surprised that \"active minutes\" never registered anything. But, today after going outside to walk and pick up downed limbs around my land I was surprised when I checked my app and already had 27 active minutes, so it definitely picks up when your walking includes more effort. I know you are supposed to be able to shower with it on, but for now I am afraid to lol. I have took it on and off with no assistance and have had NO problems with it falling off and it continues to get more comfortable. I am purposefully drinking more water so I can log it and eating less so I don't have to log it '. Also, it makes me want to keep moving so I can beat my day before. However so far can still not connect to fb to challenge my friends, this is apparently an issue for many right now. Will update again soon! ******************************************************************* I received my Fitbit flex yesterday. I chose the slate color thinking it would blend in nicely with the outfits I choose for work. I also chose the flex because of the price, until I see what I do with it and how useful I find it. I may choose to stick with the flex or upgrade depending on my experience. The packaging was great. It comes with two bands, a small and a large. The actual \"brain\" is in the large but slips easily into the small. I watched one of many YouTube videos to have a heads up on how to begin. I immediately put the \"brain\" part into the charger, included, and plugged it in with the dock from my iPhone. It reached 60% within minutes and that is all you need to begin. I downloaded the Fitbit app on my IPhone 6s and it literally walked me through step by step on how to get it set up and going. Setup was a breeze. I quickly put it on my arm, with my daughters help. The band was a little hard to get on by myself, but I did snap it and unsnap it several times before I put it in to loosen it up. Also the clasp was on the large band but it switched right over to the small easily. I walked around the house doing regular chores, checked my app and was pleased to see it was indeed counting my steps and calories burned. I decided to play with it more and went to the calories part. How easily it was to add in my food intake for the day, and it recognized each food I put in, I did not even need instructions to do this, just minutes to sit down and play with it. I was not happy to see how many calories I had actually consumed while hurriedly eating at work '. I do think this is going to make me more aware and hopefully for that I will make better choices, if I can commit to being faithful to this, we will see. I did wear it to bed and whenever I woke up I was aware that it was on my arm. I may loosen it or just see if over time I don't notice it at night, it is very comfortable when I am up and moving. I did forget to let it know I was going to bed so it did not monitor my sleep, this morning it did say I got 8.5 hours asleep, but I am not sure where that info came from. But, I did go to bed close to 10pm and was up a few minutes after 6:00 am since it is Saturday, so I'm not sure yet how the sleep part works, gonna figure that out today. I am going to consume more water just so I can add it in to my log '. And, already this morning after about an hour of housework I am surprised how many steps I have taken. So far I am excited, pleased and ready to see what I can do with Fitbit as my motivator. I will update again in a week.",

The new one has had several issues, not seeming to hold a charge, sometimes it works, looks fully charged and loses charge within a day or so and so on. I always charge it for at least two hours - usually more. I contacted customer service at Fitbit, they sent me an email telling me they were monitoring it, and two days later asked if I wanted to close the support ticket. I responded back no, that I thought they were monitoring it, then today (two days after that note) I received a survey asking me to rate their support. I read online about their great customer support and I have to say, I did not see that. I'll be researching activity tracker vendors now.

This must happen a lot, since Fitbit has a Web page devoted to suggesting ways people might get their Fitbits to charge - they say it could be a bad charging cable, a defective charging base, or that the Fitbit itself will not accept a charge. Since it is estimated Fitbit sells over 2 million activity trackers per year you'd think they could figure out how to make a unit that works reliably. Fortunately, Amazon Prime has accepted our return and will be sending us a new unit. Our two star rating is based on five stars for eight days and zero stars after that. During my wife's brief time with the Fibit on her wrist she learned two good hints for hopeful overachievers - if you vacuum a lot, or if you teach and write on a chalk board, Fitbit will give you credit for walking many extra steps! I imagine orchestra conductors also get incredible scores. Update - July 7, 2015 We returned the first Fitbit using Amazon Prime's excellent return policy. We ordered a replacement unit and so far the new unit has worked perfectly! I am increasing our rating to four stars. The current unit merits five stars, but I am sticking with four stars since we had a bad experience with the first unit, which indicates some percentage of purchasers may encounter problems with their initial Fitbits.",

I am not a very high tech person (I realized I don't really want caller ID on my wrist), so the more I read the more I realized the Flex has everything I want. It counts my steps, it moniters my sleep, I can create a food plan ( I haven't yet) and I can track my exercise and water intake. It is also fairly easy to learn to use and understand. The sleep monitoring fascinates me (this was an important feature to me), because it shows when you were awake, restless or fast asleep. It will also show how many times and for how long you were awake or restless. I recommend looking at the Fitbit website to compare \"amenities\", then reading reviews on each of them to decide which one is for you. If your looking for something to count your steps and monitor your sleep, as well as help keep take of water and calorie intake, the Flex is perfect.",

I am on my feet more hours than I sit each day. I have changed the location that I wear my tracker from my non-dominant arm (wrist) to my ankle per the recommendations of other Fitbit users. It does seem to track my active minutes and steps more accurately than it did on my arm, but it probably gives me an inaccurate count by a few hundred steps each day - i.e. It records a step when I cross or uncross my feet or legs or stretch my legs.I have opted to stay with wearing it on my ankle because it does recognize the full length and distance on the treadmill, whereas on my wrist it did not. The sleep recording seems pretty accurate. I wish that it was done without having to enter the waking time each day - it seems to me that if it can tell when I'm awake through the night it should recognize when I am out of bed. This model does have limited recording capabilities, but if your primary interest is tracking steps and distance, it is sufficient. I would not benefit from having more features, and I am not sure that a more advanced model would offer a higher level of accuracy. Overall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars because while I am able to use it and do use it daily, I have not yet found it to be any more useful than a good pedometer would be for me.",

The app will walk you through syncing to your phone, setting up goals and connecting to friends. Once set up you can log steps counted (shocking for a pedometer, right), calorie burn from other exercise, food intake, water intake and sleep. It is comfortable to wear, the battery life is decent and frankly being able to work towards fitness targets is a great motivator so it keeps you accountable. Where does the madness lie, I hear you ask. Challenges. The in app challenges will turn normally quite sane friends and family members into step obsessed lunatics. They work by allowing you to invite your Fitbit friends to see who can get the most steps in a day, work week or weekend. During the challenge time you get updates on how you are doing verses the step totals of everyone else in the challenge. If your work buddy powers past you, you'll get a notification through the app. Should you are your sister in law be neck and neck you'll both get a message letting you know. If you are even a little bit competitive this can lead to mayhem. Let's just say my wife and I are two people who don't like losing, especially to each other. I have found Mrs B. walking in tight circles in the kitchen while cooking, just to up that step count a little higher. I have been known to slip out of the house to get a quick walk around the block in, in an effort to make sure that she doesn't catch me. We've had reports of other family members watching TV while walking in place just to make sure they don't fall behind on a challenge. Don't get me wrong, the challenges are a lot of fun and really help you get more steps in which is great for your physical health. It's just neighbors who have seen me aimlessly walking around our back yard while muttering about step counts have started avoiding me in the street.",

The little grooves that it is suppose to \"snap\" into are so tight that it is almost impossible to do for us senior citizen folks. And to top it off the band is rubber and it causes me to sweat and then itch afterwards. 2. not being able to actually see what progress that you are making unless you know how to sync it up with your computer or cell phone. Since all you get to see is a little flashing light there is no instant gratification and if you are not overly cell phone suave then knowing how to get it set up is a challenge and there is no real instructions that come with it to tell you how it works. 3 with this model you are suppose to be able to \"tap it\" at night and get this little vibration to tell you that it is in sleep mode but I have had this for three weeks and I've only been able to get it to go into the sleep mode three times. I \"tap it\" twice like it says and nothing happens, I then \"tap it\" a little harder and still nothing...it is just so not worth the energy. So if you are looking at getting this, just know these are things that you too could encounter. The money put out for it, the value is sooo not there!",

There are a lot of great tools on the Fitbit site, and I like being able to add friends so that we can motivate each other. This little guy isn't perfect -- if you want to track your sleep, it will assume you are asleep if you lie very still. It is also easy to accidentally put the flex in sleep mode by banging your arm around on things, but it is also easy enough to remove the sleep information from the Fitbit site. The silent alarm is a fantastic feature since my husband works second shift and I always feel bad for setting a loud morning alarm, although one morning I was in a very deep sleep and didn't feel it go off. Overall, though, for people who like visuals, and people who enjoy tech and messing around on the computer, I recommend the flex to help keep you motivated with your fitness goals.",

            "review_text": "I bought the FitBit primarily to see if my sleeping patterns were as bad as I thought they were. I have back issues and wanted to have something objective to show my doctors on how serious this was affecting my sleep. My surgeon was not familiar with the device but was quite impressed when I showed him my sleep patterns on my tablet. To get accurate readings I suggest using the \"sensitive mode\" on the sleep monitor. This shows every time you toss and turn. Without sensitive mode you will only see periods where you moved around a lot in short period of time. The FitBit does require internet access to get the data off the device, and it appears your data is stored on their servers, not your PC. But you can download the results for archiving. Once you create an account, you can login using a browser on any PC or tablet since is does have an excellent android app (which I like better than the PC web version!) If you leave the USB dongle in your PC it will sync automatically whenever you are near your PC, and update periodically without you having to do anything. You can also sync manually, but for some reason this often requires me to reenter my account information which is not needed if it synced automatically and you set your online account to not require login when you access it. Now that my back is on the mend (recent surgery which went well) I hope to start using is as an exercise monitor as well. The only issues I have with the design is the straps do break easily near the window area. I find this can be avoided to a large degree by using your fingers to prevent bending that area when inserting or removing the device. I have not had a strap break since I started doing that. Both FitBit and aftermarket suppliers offer a wide variety of strap colors and designs. One option which I recommend it a band that goes over the clip to prevent the strap from opening if you snag it on something. These bands come with some aftermarket straps, or can be purchased separately. I suggest getting a band that is wide enough to cover the whole clip so it offers better protection and is less likely to slide off the clip. A note to anyone who has issues with recharging their FitBit Flex: the little copper terminals on the device need to be CLEANED once in a while. I find using a wooden toothpick works well. Just use the tip to get any residue out of the holes, then when the tip gets flat (it will) use a twisting motion to polish the contacts. You will find the device will now easily connect with your charging cable without having to stuff something into it to force a better connection. This approach is now approved/recommended on the FitBit website, but I was doing it before they added this cleaning method.",

            "review_text": "I bought this for my wife because she had to have it; it's the latest craze at work! I don't share her sentiment. It's a glorified pedometer and not much more than that. The pedometer can't be used alone. You have to create an account and use the web-based interface or the app they tote for Android/iOS. If you're looking for instructions you won't find them in the box. They direct you to their website for setup instead. There's not a lot of documentation on normal operation. I'm still waiting to see what happens when the battery dies. The device uses a dongle to sync with the PC (computer) which is fine if you have constant access to a computer to update your progress. If, however, you expect to sync throughout the day with your phone like my wife intended to do, you will most likely run into problems unless you're sporting the latest and greatest Samsung, iPhone, iPad, Sony, or HTC. The pedometer uses Bluetooth v4.0 Smart (also called Low Energy) and is not backwards compatible with any other version of Bluetooth. This is not clearly stated anywhere on their site or with their retailers. My wife wanted this so she could compete with her coworkers on various challenges (out-stepping) but since she can't check progress or accept challenges until she gets home the pedometer is relatively useless. If we had known this upfront we would have saved our $99 for something useful. I don't keep up with the advancement of Bluetooth technology. I've sent files, connected to speakers/headsets, and used Bluetooth controllers. Beyond that, I couldn't tell you the difference between 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, or 4.0 Smart. I only know that it's required for this device because of all the contact I've had with customer service. Also, if you have Bluetooth 4.0 it doesn't guarantee that your device is compatible. It has to be Smart or Low Energy. I was told this by FitBit support and they recommended that I buy one of the phones/devices on their compatible devices list. I am on a prepaid plan and I buy my phones outright to save money. I cannot and will not justify buying a phone between $300 to $600 to use a pedometer. This device is a pedometer. It doesn't matter how you dress it up. It is what it is. If you've ever used a conventional pedometer then you know how accurate they are/aren't. This thing doesn't do any better and costs ten times as much. If you're into the latest fad then this device is for you. If you want something practical and efficient then I suggest you look elsewhere.",

It requires you to haul out your phone or check your computer every time you want to see your stats. It takes up two USB ports on your computer, one for the charger and one for the dongle. It's inconvenient to remove it from the wristband for charging all the time. The wristband is quite fugly, its clasp is difficult to work. If you also wear a watch (because, inexplicably, the Flex doesn't even have a clock), expect an uncomfortably cluttered wrist. My Flex quit working within a month. Unit wouldn't hold a charge. Was basically rebooting it daily until it went completely kaplooey. Then the wristband busted. Lucky me, customer service sent me a replacement after I produced a copy of my Amazon receipt. When I went to register it at the website, I discovered that they're coming out with a new model (the \"Force\") that seems to address several of the shortcomings of the Flex. This \"Force\" development was pretty irritating, since I'd already shelled out $100 for a flawed product that I only got a few weeks' use out of, only to discover that the model they should have released in the first place will now cost me $125. Based on the cruddy build quality of the Flex, I won't be buying the new model.",

Unfortunately what everyone warned me about came true - the wrist band comes apart easily, and mine did. Almost a month from purchase I lost it while out and about. At ~$100 \"a pop\" I can't afford another one, and it's unfortunate that it happened. If they ever come up with a band that has a better locking mechanism I might reconsider, but for now, my love affair with Fitbit is over.",

I had it synced to phone but it used too much of my data so I can only sync to my computer which means I can only check progress in the am and pm. One of the main reasons I wanted to use it was for sleep analysis. The device seems to be accurate as to the time I go to sleep. However, I generally awaken at least 1 hour - 1 1/2 hours before I have to get up. The device shows I slept until my feet actually hit the floor therefore it is not accurate. I will say it shows me as restless upwards of 20x's per night. I suspect every time I move my arm, it logs that movement as restless. I use a program called Spark People for my nutrition and exercise tracking. The device doesn't sync well with Spark People so I gave up trying to log nutrition and exercise on the Fitbit. Spark People is much easier to use. I don't like the way the band clasp closes. It is VERY hard to clasp. I am disappointed in the band it is already \"stained\" around the edges and it's not even a month old yet. As for optional band accessories, I'd like to see a variety of options perhaps more colors to represent causes such as \"the blue line\" and different cancer awareness. I don't recommend this item. I guess you get what you pay for. If I could I would return it and go for one of the more expensive fitbits or perhaps a different brand of tracker.",

I sent online and read the FAQs about it not charging and did everything that the web site told me to do...cleaning the connection points, changing USB ports, everything. I still have issues with it charging and the FItbit customer service is frustrating. They can see the activity of the Fitbit through the website, so every time I've contacted them by the time they get around to responding I've finally got the thing to charge, so they see only that it charged. There is definitely something wrong with the charging mechanism but since they only see that it has charged, they don't seem to motivated to fix the charging mechanism. The Fitbit itself seems to work wonderfully (when charged) and when the band broke, the company sent me a replacement free of charge. Since I'm tired of fighting the charging issue, I'm looking at replacing it with a different type of tracker. And just for record, when I have posted on the Fitbit forum about my charging issues, I've received almost 60 different people with feedback about their same problem...so it's not just mine.",

I'm already an avid walker, but there are days I am stuck at the computer and I wanted something to make me get up and get moving to reach a walking goal. I immediately set it up and started tracking. I have been scrupulous about wearing it all day and going frequently to the dashboard to track my steps. From the very beginning the steps have been grossly under-reported, disappointingly crediting me with far fewer steps than I actually walked every day. I often walk with others who are also tracking their own mileage, usually on phone apps or having driven the distance beforehand to know what we will be walking. Every single time, my tracking is far below what it should be. For example, this past Saturday we did a 6 mile walk. If it was a couple of tenths on either side of that I could understand. But at the end of the day, with all the additional steps I took that day, including taking the dog for a walk, my fitbit had only recorded 5.91 miles. In this instance, I had probably walked 8 miles. My fitbit is on my non-dominant wrist, as advised. I have tried resetting my steps by measuring my stride and putting this information in my profile, but unfortunately none of this makes a difference. Instead of being motivating, this device has actually become demotivating and an unnecessary stressor in my life (as if I don't have enough stress!) I have gone to fitbit's 'help' forum and the reviews here and there are many similar stories. I have had this less than two months and thought I might be able to return it, but unfortunately that option expired after a month, so I'm stuck with something I paid nearly $100 for and can't use.

Or should I say, LACK OF customer service. *** Updated*** DO NOT BUY fitbit. It is now less than three months from purchase and the tracker does not sync to iPhone anymore. I contacted fitbit and all I received back from them was a refurbished \"tracker\" (nothing else) packaged in a plastic bag. When I first spoke to fitbit about this issue, I asked them if I should return the items back to them? I was told, \"No go ahead and throw them away. We are mailing you a new tracker.\" Now, I have the part that slips into the bracelet, but no bracelet, no dongle and no charger since I was originally told by them that they were sending a new tracker. When I purchased the \"tracker\", the box came with two bracelets, a syncing dongle and a charger. When they said new, I assumed they meant everything, not a new/refurbished suppository. When I first contacted them about the issue I asked them if they would upgrade since they no longer manufacture the Flex and they now make the Flex 2. I even offered to pay the price difference. They told me that they did not offer an upgrade program. Instead, they did offer a discount for a new Flex 2. OK I'm a sucker, and I opted to upgrade to the Flex 2 (another $90 if you include taxes and shipping). Now after waiting for two weeks, (originally shipping was within one to two weeks of purchase) they tell me that the tracker is back on back order and the wait time is no longer two weeks it's now one a half months. Since the ONLY reason I' upgrading is because their three month old tracker broke, how about taking care of customers first. NO fitbit, just screws up the order and then does nothing to try to accommodate it's customers. My opinion of fitbit. the Company is TERRIBLE! And does NOT give a damn about its loyal customers. MY Recommendation: DO NOT PURCHASE A FITBIT PRODUCT! I'll purchase my tracker form another manufacturer, after all, fiitbit is not the only game in town.",

The sleep tracking seems to be right on with what I actually remember from the night before, plus it tracks unconscious movement. I got my wife one also, and her sleep tracking is also right on with what she remembers from the night before. It also tracks my naps without having to turn on sleep tracking. There is a review saying you no longer need to turn on sleep tracking mode anymore, the Flex automatically knows when you are asleep. But I have not tried that at night. There are also a lot of bad reviews concerning Fitbit customer service, basically they suck at customer service, but as I have had the Flex for about a week, I have not contacted them... yet. I will update this review periodically. The app that you need to use with the Fitbit Flex is an awesome app. It's full of very useful info, and can keep you busy while you research your own activity and sleep. It's also safe. Almost every other app I've looked at, is based out of China, and asks for way to many permissions. The only reason this does not get 5 stars, is the form of communication between your Flex and your phone, I'm talking about Bluetooth. I am a network engineer and know a significant amount about wireless security. Bluetooth is the most open form of wireless communication. In other words, it is extremely easy to hack. Less experienced hackers will just be able to see all of your fitness tracking and name. But the more experienced will be able to take control of your phone, not to mention see everything you have on your phone. Now it's important to say that newer phones have some form of protection from Bluetooth hackers, but leaving your Bluetooth on everywhere you go is still a little dangerous. There is nothing you can do about the signal coming from your Flex, but that is just your activity info. If you are going to be leaving your Bluetooth on your phone on, then you need to encrypt your phone. This can be done in the security section of your phone's settings menu. Also, make sure your Bluetooth discovery is turned off. The Bluetooth signal coming from your Flex, is a bubble about 20 feet in every direction around you, including through most walls. Keeping these things in mind will help, but always also keep in mind that any wireless communication can be hacked. Don't be paranoid about it because chances are you're not important or rich enough to be a target. But don't put it completely out of your mind either. But overall, the Flex does exactly what it says it does. It is a great little tracker.",

The cons: Not sure how much I love being tethered to a wristband all day, but that's just me getting used to wearing something that's monitoring me. That's a definite adjustment. The band is thicker and bulkier than I expected. Many people have reported issues with the clasp, and yes, it is a silly way to construct the device. Of yet the only problem with it is sometimes difficulty closing it, but I rarely take it off. I can see how it will become an issue, though. The biggest problem for me is as follows. The first couple of nights, I tapped the thing repeatedly to get it into sleep mode. Each subsequent morning, I'd do the same and regardless, it would happen within a matter of seconds (no more than 3 or 4). Now, having had it (and worn it in the shower and ocean - but less than 10M), the tapping seems to be a lot less successful and I often have to tap repeatedly for 10 or more seconds. It's highly annoying and does not bode well moving forward. I haven't used the food app so I can't speak for it. It does sync with My Net Diary, which is the food diary/app I use. However, I didn't like Flex's calorie and mileage counts so I have just started inputting to My Net Diary based on what Runkeeper tells me for walking and running.

It tracked steps and worked as a silent alarm clock, but I went through two trackers and three bands within this time period. Of course, I was right outside of the warranty period. Warranty was one year and since mine stopped working/syncing out of the blue shortly after that, I had to pay for a new one myself. Support tried to help fix it, but they couldn't. As new versions (charge, charge + HR, etc) came out, I quickly learned the flex was outdated. It just wasn't reliable and didn't have any of the added features of these new versions. I've had a Fitbit Charge + HR for nearly a year now, and it was so worth the upgrade. Now you may not want a larger band like the Charge has, which is fine. Even then I would say go with the Altria (skinny band but upgraded). I had that for a couple weeks but ultimately returned because I like the heart rate feature of the Charge.

Pros: When it works, it's great, auto syncs with Weight Watchers e-tools which is main reason I purchased. Cons: Drops sync often. GPS activity totally inaccurate. Walked known 1.6 mi. route and GPS logged me at 3.5 mi. During regular step counting, the Flex often had me burning 1300-1400 cals for a 2.5 mi. casual walk. My Galaxy S5 phone with S-health feature, and my pedometer are consistent with about 300-350 cals. I've gone back to my $20, 5-year-old Omron pedometer. It tracks steps, miles, calories, separates aerobic steps (with # min. in aerobic mode) and, by golly, it tells the time !! The only downside is remembering to clip it to my waist and I have to manually log activity points on Weight Watcher e-tools. Boo hoo, poor little me!!

Then I put it on my right wrist and changed the setting to \"non-dominant wrist\" but the step count was still off because every time I move my arm, the thing counts it as a step. I work at a desk where I move my arms back and forth all day long. I paid $86 and some change for this and I am not impressed at all in the very least. Save your money folks!",

It's not precise, so if you are looking for something that measures 100% accurately, this is not that thing. But it's better than a pedometer and much more convenient. I could wish this was waterproof because I frequently take mine off to do dishes and then forget to put it back on. There is a waterproof version. All that being said, if you are not highly into techy features and precise accuracy, having one of these things will definitely help you to keep moving. I'd say this version is for people who are trying to increase their fitness on a beginner level.

            "review_text": "My eight-year old son requested a Fitbit for his birthday. It may seem strange, but I know he hears me and my friends talking about Fitbits all the time, and he gets in on the conversations about our challenges. Anyway, we bought him one, and he loves it! We have it synced to my husband's phone, and he has joined challenges with me. Because he gets to go out for recess and because I am a slacker, he usually beats me. :) For those of you who do not know what a Fitbit is, let me explain it to you. A Fitbit is a tool to help people measure how much exercise they are getting. This one is worn like a bracelet, and so long as it is charged, it keeps track of how many steps you take in one day. For a person who doesn't work out regularly, the goal is to take 10,000 steps in one day. However, I changed my goal to 15,000 steps each day because it forced me to get some extra steps in on a daily basis. Anyway, so the Fitbit helps you keep track of how many steps you take. The steps taken is then transferred into two different calculations: miles walked and calories burned. I have used an app to measure my running distance in comparison with the Fitibit, and I find that it is usually within .2 miles of what the app says. The jury is still out on calories burned, however. As with any fitness device, it is hard to know if they are estimating correctly. When I wear my heart rate monitor, I find that both my Fitbit and my son's Fitbit overcalculate how many calories burned. The same goes for most Fitness apps though, so perhaps it is my heart rate monitor? Either way, if you are a person who is tracking your calories in versus calories out, I would say to be cautious about taking the calories burned as a accurate measure, just in case. If you are looking for a gift for just about anyone, this would be a great idea! Like I said, my son is 8 years old and loves his. He requested it, so I guess it's not a huge surprise. This would also be a great gift for someone who is looking to lose weight and get fit (swimsuit season right around the corner, right?), or for a person who is just religious about exercise and wants another way to keep track of activity. It comes in different colors too if you don't like the orange. :) The Fitbit Flex also has a sleep monitor, which tells you how well you slept and how long you slept. My son doesn't wear his to bed, but I've worn mine to bed before. Honestly, I already know how well I sleep and don't sleep, so I didn't learn a lot of information by wearing it to bed. It might be interesting for some people though. Likewise, it has an alarm that you can set, but neither my son nor I use the alarm either. Anyway, it's a pretty cool little gadget. Makes exercise a friendly competition for my family. :)",

The flex tracks, steps, sleep, and miles. You can sync mapmyrun app with the Fitbit app as well! I have noticed the miles on the Fitbit do not match the miles logged on map my run but it isn't too off. Love buying different bands for the flex which you cannot do with the other models.

This makes it substantially less accurate than a $5 pedometer that clips onto your belt, or pants, or goes in a pocket. If you are not swinging your arms, Fitbit thinks you are not walking. If you are pushing a cart around a supermarket, or Costco, or some such, your steps will not be reliably recorded. One time I spent an hour shopping in Costco. Fitbit recorded 12 steps! Conversely, if you scratch a mosquito bite, or scratch your back, Fitbit will record a bunch of steps. Fitbit tracks your sleep, as well as your steps. While subject to the occasional bizarre result, the sleep tracker is pretty impressive. The big difference between Fitbit and other pedometers is the social media aspect. You can hook up with friends and family and let them see your results, and see theirs. Fitbit affirmatively encourages competition. To the extent that improves health, or is fun, that is great. In our experience, folks tire of the novelty over time. Finally, the Fitbit band leaves something to be desired. It has a unique fastening system. Unique, but not good. It is a bit of a nuisance.",

Battery life is about average with a need to charge at least once a week and sometimes twice a week. I havent noticed a pattern on the discharge so I could always charge it on the third day for example) I also like the silent alarm (vibrates till you tap it) for waking up. I have not noticed much of an advantage from the sleep monitoring. You have to remember to tap it twice so it knows you are going to sleep and I often forget. Also I do not know how accurate this really is. I do not like that you have to pay around 49 dollars a year if you want your data to be stored. This could be easily achieved with a program you have on your computer and sync the data there and store it locally. I havent really researched what you get with the 49 dollars a year but it is too much to pay anyway. So overall I would recommend this to others.

What I DO like, when the sleep mode is working correctly, is that it makes me go to bed earlier and more mindful of how much sleep/rest I am getting (it's not entirely accurate as it tracks your movements, so if you're awake but lying still it might count that as sleeping), and how restless I was during the night. I also like that it tracks every step taken, whether you're walking to the copy machine, around the house, etc., so you're more mindful of moving, so that you can beat yesterday's step count.",

I find the two programs most compatible for walking. What I find most amazing about the fitbit is that if I take an afternoon nap, it knows to track it under the \"sleep component\". It has helped me to try to figure out what may have disrupted my sleep, since it confirms when I know I've has a bad night. I also like that I earn virtual badges and awards when I reach goals. I'm glad I got it--no regrets. It is very easy to sync with my laptop. The one setback is that in order to sync I need to use the wireless receiver that came with the band, so I have to move it to my PC if I want to use that to sync.

First, because it tracks only hand/arm movements, it is grossly inaccurate as an activity tracker. You can literally stand still in the kitchen chopping veggies and rack up huge activity \"steps.\" Second, it markets itself as calculating calories burned and then has the nerve to report how many calories you have left to consume for the day--you guessed it, based on grossly inaccurate activity results. Not only is it not capable of calculating calories burned with any accuracy, whatsoever, how much harm could it be doing by recommending that you consume ever increasing amounts of calories, based on the overestimation of activity?? (Why would you want to consume additonal calories burned, anyway?) Finally, it cannot and does not at all track or monitor your sleep. It tracks the movement of your hand or arm during the time that it is activated in sleep mode. No movement does not indicate sleep, just as movement does not indicate the absence of sleep. So, this is a total waste of money. I'll give an example of results. I used the Flex during a walk(1 min)/run (1 min) exercise activity for 60 mins and 3.3 miles. Since it does not calcuate any idividual activities, but only gives cummulative data, I wrote down the calories burned before and after the activity, performing highly advanced mathematics to subtract and come up with the difference as calories burned. It told me that I had burned over 800 calories. Great news!! 800 MORE calories to eat that day! When I work out really hard on my AMT for 60 mins at level 10, the machine and my Garmin+heart rate monitor (and earlier my Polar+heart rate monitor) tell me that I am extremely lucky to get to 600 calories burned. So, how nice that I can go out for a gentle walk/jog and burn so many more calories than I would having to actually work hard on the machine! Suspicious, I bought the Garmin+heart rate monitor and did a test. I used the Garmin+heart rate monitor to walk(1 min)/run (2 min) for the exact same route of 3.3 miles--guess what? Only 198 calories! Guess I will have to skip the double scoop ice cream sundae! Assuming most people want to get fit and/or lose weight, this gross inaccuracy, combined with the incredibly irresponsible suggestion to increase calorie intake based on it, make this not only a waste of money but a danger to people in making health and consumption decisions.",

I tried to set up my account on my iPad and while I could download the app, it was of absolutely no help for getting the Fitbit set up. It is a really bad interface. It asks me which device I have and then there is nothing to click on to continue setup. It wasted 15-20 minutes of my time. The connector for the wristband is hard to connect. The connector turns out to be a well-known problem. When the bracelet is new, the connector is hard to work. When the bracelet is older, the device falls off. As evidence, I offer the products you can buy to keep the connector fastened. Think about it - one company is making a living by selling products to fix Fitbit's deficiencies! I've had my thingamabob in the charger for 20 hours. All the lights are blinking. When I take it out of the charger, it goes dark, then one light goes on and then turns off. Battery issues are well known in the Fitbit community. There are directions on how to clean the battery. Cleaning mine did not help. How can a company advertise a product with a high out-of-the-box failure? The web site is not very helpful. I had to search to find the way to email the company. The auto-response says that they have so many emails that it will take at least 2 days to get back to me. I have an out-of-box failure and it will take 2 days? I concluded that they are dealing with widespread failures if it takes that long. This company has to be on its last legs. It spent a fortune on advertising a product that is not ready for the market because it does not function reliably. Having spent that money on a failing product, they have not invested in serving customers well. I expect far more for my $100. I'm through with the Fitbit company forever.",

First off for the price is too high for a unit that just blinks dots to show you within 2000 steps of how many you have ( my goal is set at 10,000 steps per day) and makes you open an app on your phone for an exact step count is just too high. Also, you are wearing this in place of a watch and it doesn't give you the time. You have to step up to a pricier model if you want the time. Also, the jelly strap with cheap attaching system they give you for the band pops off every time I pull off a sweater or bump it on something. Inhale this poo off my wrist at least once a day and thankfully have found it afterwards. People have told me you can buy more secure bands for it, but for the price of this unit you think they would give you one. My son bought my wife a Chinese unit that counted steps, vibrated and show text messages and phone callers, show calories burned, distance traveled in miles and had a sleep alarm to vibrate to wake you up all for half the price. She didn't want a step counter so I took hers and my flex is sitting in the drawer.",

It's easy to switch in and out of the provided band and the other more jewelry like bracelets I purchased. Here are a few things to know: 1) The \"turn the wrist to view\" function only works 30% of the time. I have noticed that this device will turn on sometimes when I'm sleeping and the light wakes me up. 2) The sleep tracker is my favorite function. I'm one of those who wakes up tired several times a week. This sleep tracker is helping me see how much sleep I'm actually getting and at what time(s). I'm working on improving my sleep quality because of this. 3) I like seeing my texts without checking my phone. It would be nice if there was a way to review the text or call alerts after the initial notification. 4) I wish this had a heart rate monitor. I know I could have gotten the Charge 2, but I did not have a place to physically compare the 2 models to see which I liked better and which fit my wrist better. (I'm only 5'1 and have super small wrists). I was concerned the Charge 2 would be too big on me. ** If you are a very active person trying to decide between the Alta and the Charge 2... get the Charge 2! 5) To view the display you need to tap the band below the screen face- don't tap the screen face. Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the other reviews that listed this piece of advice. It's 100% accurate and it kept me from getting irritated the first few days of wearing this device. I'm going to use the Alta for a while , but then I might change to a Charge 2. Given my active lifestyle the Charge 2 is a better model for me, but I was concerned about the size of the Charge 2 (see point 4).",

Cleaning the contacts worked for a while, but eventually it just stopped taking a charge altogether. Disappointing, but at least I got a couple years out of it. I ordered another one a few weeks ago. There was enough of a charge on it to set it up, so I did that. Then I plugged it into the charging cable. The lights flashed, then nothing. It won't charge. Pressing on it so that it makes better contact with the cable helps, but I can't really do that all day while it charges. Googling shows that this is a common problem and simply poor product design. The compartment to hold the fitbit is too big to maintain pressure against the contacts. Most people seem to deal with this by jamming a paper clip into the end of the adapter to apply enough pressure to keep the fitbit connected to the contacts so it charges. (There are plenty of YouTube videos demonstrating this.) That seems to work, but that's an unacceptable fix for a product just minutes out of the box. It has apparently been a problem for years, but there don't seem to be any plans to fix it. Very disappointing.",

I was originally really excited about it, but became shortly disappointed for 2 reasons. 1) We have a baby, and go on a lot of walks together with him. For some reason, pushing a stroller with a Fitbit does not accumulate as many steps as just normal walking. We have switched Fitbits and done trials and its just not even close. For a while I had him wear mine while we were walking together, but all that effort just to get an accurate step count is not worth it. 2) The band broke! I was wearing it for about 4 months and the part where the fitbit is placed within the band just tore and now it won't stay in place and just falls out. Eventually, since it was not accurately recording my steps anyway, I just stopped wearing it. Which is too bad, I should have just gotten the clip and paid a lot less money for it, no strap to break, and actually records your steps while pushing a stroller.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I am not am expert in fitness by ANY means and have only used the kind of tracker that you have to wear the monitor around your torso (hated, hated, hated that). I bought the Fitbit Flex after considerable research, and was attracted to the wireless feature, the slim profile, and the fact that it tracks sleep (more on that in a bit). I am NOT an athlete... I am a non-athletic middle aged woman trying to lose weight and get motivated by tracking my activity and pushing myself by setting goals and working out. A major pre-emptive strike before the holidays and a vacation in January that will involve the dreaded bathing suit in public scenario. First, set up. It is not entirely intuitive and the packaging does not come with a lot of instruction so once you get it go right in the website www.fitbit.com, pick Flex and spend a good amount if time reading through everything. This is not one of those \"I don't want to read the instructions, I will just wing it\" things. Get yourself set up with an account (it's free). Put the Fitbit on your non dominant wrist and presto that sucker starts tracking right away. Start moving and once you check back onto your dashboard on the computer you will get what it is tracking and how. It's amazing. Steps taken, number of active minutes, calories out (and calories in if you track your food), sleep patterns, etc. all displayed in a very easy to understand visual dashboard. I love it. (And I admit it is can be a bit obsessive, checking back all the time, but it totally motivates me to take those extra steps or do 30 mins more on the treadmill so I can up my stats... I am competing with myself and that works for me.) It does not track your heart rate for a specific activity so if you want that, this Fitbit won't give it. What it does instead, is track overall activity against the goals you set. The wrist band itself is very comfortable and light weight. It is waterproof and I don't take it off ever, except to charge it (your dashboard even tells you when it is time to charge - I found the charge lasts almost 5 days, just as advertised). This is an important feature (the comfort), because I cannot wear any jewelry to bed usually, it just bugs me. The fitnbit did not bother me at all. The charging took me a bit to master - you take the little tracker gizmo out of the wrist band and insert it into a cradle. The cradle has a USB attachment which I assumed I could plug into the USB wall charger base that I use for my I Pad and I Phone. Wrong. It doesn't charge with those for some reason. Plug the the charging cradle right into the USB port on your computer or laptop and it charges fine in about three hours. I downloaded the Fitbit app on both my iPhone and IPad and the dashboards look a bit different on each device but it all works and you figure out which device to go to depending on how much info you want to see. The phone app is cool for a quick check but I usually look at it on the computer for detailed stats. The sleep monitoring is eye opening. I have complained often of not being a great sleeper (that whole slightly over weight middle aged woman hormone thing). The Fitbit tracks when you go to bed, how long it takes you to fall asleep, how many hours you sleep, how often you wake up, and the number of times you are restless and gives you a percentage of sleep effiency. Turns out I am sleeping better than I thought I was, and after a while you see patterns you can assess against times, activity, diet, etc., to improve the quality of your sleep. So, all in all, I am a big fan. Been wearing a couple of months and the weight is slowly coming off and my activity level has significantly increased. I highly recommend this unit.",

As far as tracking your steps, this does a great job, better than my old pedometer, however, it also picks up vibration and strong movements, so be aware this could skew your actual step reading. I once logged a mile of walking just driving over the potholes with my car! It also counts clapping, so remove it when you are attending your grandchildren's school events. The tracker will also count steps when in your pocket or purse. The Fitbit lasts about 5 days between charges. With time, the battery life has slowed to about 3 days in between charging, but that is expected with all battery devices. If you have a Fitbit Flex, be sure and download the app for your phone, add friends, accept challenges and you will be more satisfied and happy with your results.

Then I lose the points for that day with my company fitness program. 2) the band is way too bulky. It doesn't fit under my shirt sleeve for work, catches on my jacket, etc. 3) there is no information on the display. In fact there is no display really. It's rubbish, I have to synchronize Fitbit with the phone on their app, and then ensure my work Virgin Pulse account also synchs. Hassle. At least with the pod one you could see steps on the screen.

Luckily, Amazon was more than willing to send a replacement and let me keep my current unit until it arrived, so while I couldn't sync I could still keep tracking. In the end, I lost about three days worth of data, but with a working unit my experience has been much more positive. I'm glad Amazon cared more about customer service than Fitbit apparently did. The app is pretty well-done; since the calorie tracker has a barcode scanner I've pretty much replaced LoseIt with Fitbit, and the ability to sync other devices to my dashboard means I can keep track of my weight, body fat, etc. with my Withings WS-50 Smart Body Analyzer, Black , which I'd originally bought to integrate with LoseIt. Some of the app features are very \"so what?\" such as the sleeping potion, which records sleep and nothing else really, so products like the UP 24 by Jawbone - Bluetooth Enabled - Medium - Retail Packaging - Onyx definitely win for app usefulness. I really do enjoy this product though, and I've gotten to the point that I rarely even notice I have it on until I hit my steps goal for the day. [Original Review: 9/23/2014] I really have loved this band for the time that I've had it, but customer service is just impossible to deal with right now. I don't know if they just sent out a really terrible batch of of devices or what, but their response time is terrible for such an expensive and clearly lucrative company. The battery doesn't last quite as long as advertised; I noticed this just a few days in. That's not such a huge issue, but the problems and annoyances kept piling up. My sync dongle crapped out about three days into my having owned the Flex, just refused to show up as connected no matter what port or what computer it was plugged in to, and I ended up waiting over a week for a non-automated response from customer service. I gave them a pretty detailed account of the situation, and received the equivalent of \"Have you tried turning it off and on again?\" Of course I followed every troubleshooting step on the site - I wouldn't have contacted customer service if I hadn't. I wouldn't have minded that useless email so much, If I hadn't waited another full 24 hours for the next response, which basically repeated my words back and and followed up with essentially \"Try returning it for a replacement unit.\" Aside from the fact that its more than possible to replace the dongle separately from the Flex unit (and from the forums I know for a fact that they have), if I'm sending this back to Amazon I'm going to pick up a more dependable product with better customer service in its stead. The Garmin Vivofit is looking pretty good.",

            "review_text": "This product worked fine for three weeks, syncing with both my iPhone and laptop with no problems. Two days ago, I began to get a notice when I attempted to sign into the app on my laptop that my phone's 'date or time' was incorrect. It isn't, and I get the FitBit information perfectly on my iPhone. I've deleted and re-installed the app, restarting my computer afterwards. Same problem. Found the same problem reported in an online FitBit support group. A couple were able to solve the problem, but some, like me, weren't. This is a lot of money to pay for a product with so many potential problems. I wouldn't buy it again. Not only that, FitBit does NOT provide any online help or help phone number, so if you buy it and have problems, you're essentially on your own. UPDATE: I DID buy another Fitbit Flex when the first one totally malfunctioned at about month 4. The Flex has all the features I want: steps, sleep, weight, plus a few others I don't. I don't want a watch or to be alerted to phone calls or texts, so the Flex is great. I love the Dashboard and the long-term record of progress in different areas. So handy....and a great motivator for me. The second Flex began malfunctioning about two months ago AND the Dashboard lost the steps and sleep tiles. I was successful with tech support, fortunately, and they sent a replacement Flex because my old one was still under warranty. Just before the replacement arrived, everything suddenly started working again, so I put the new one away as a backup. Two days ago, the syncing problems began again and the steps/sleep/250 steps an hour tiles disappeared. I know all the steps by now and went through them. I deleted the device, dumped the Dashboard app and reloaded it, turned on Bluetooth and synced the device. Even went through system restore on my PC. The Dashboard came back with all the tiles, but the second I clicked on 'sync,' the steps/sleep/250 steps tiles disappeared. I've gone through the dump/reload/sync process at least ten times. I even got out the NEW Flex. Same results. The most puzzling thing is why the tiles I need and want are no longer available, even with fresh downloads. SO frustrated. I've looked into other trackers, but haven't yet found anything that gives me the basics - plus a Dashboard option. Not sure what I'm going to do. Sure missing my WORKING Flex and Dashboard.",

            "review_text": "I've been using my Fitbit Flex for 6 months now, and have been very satisfied with it. I bought it solely as a pedometer, but quickly grew to appreciate the accompanying Fitbit app. My Fitbit tracks how many calories I burn each day, and I use the app on my smart phone to track what I've eaten. (The app is worthy of its own review, but the succinct version is that it is very easy to use- I can look up foods by brand or enter my own recipe's nutritional information without much effort. I can also track other types of exercise and count those burnt calories.) By setting a goal on my app (I chose a 500 calorie deficit each day) and being diligent about recording my food intake, I've lost 17 pounds in 6 months without stressing about it. I knew I needed to take action to get fit after having 2 kids and a series of stressful events had led me to significant weight gain, but I really didn't want to go on a \"diet.\" I don't feel like I'm on a diet- the app program is very similar to Weight Watchers: it just counts calories- and I don't feel like I'm on a fitness regimen, but I'm starting to feel better about myself, and people have started to notice. There are nights that I find myself pacing around my living room to get 700 more steps and meet my daily goal- it's always a fun surprise when the bracelet vibrates and lights up for several seconds to congratulate me. I chose the Flex because I liked the sleep tracking function- as a mom of 2 young kids, I am ALWAYS tired. It may seem silly, but seeing empirical evidence that I wake up an average of 16 times a night (yes, really) encouraged my husband to get up with the baby more often. The Charge came out shortly after I got my Fitbit, but I would not have chosen that over my Flex. The Flex is only about half an inch wide, and I don't really notice it on my arm (I wear it 24/7, even in the shower.) I find the Charge to be too bulky. I have to charge my flex every 4 or 5 days. I have 2 chargers for it- one to use if I happen to be sitting at my computer for a while, and the other in my car- that way I don't miss tracking any steps while I charge it. I'd say it takes about 30-45 minutes to charge fully if I wait until I get the e-mail saying my battery is low. (Can we just reflect for a moment on the fact that my bracelet sends me an e-mail saying it needs to be charged?) The Fitbit bands are comfortable, are easy to put on, and stay on throughout my daily activity. They are, however, quite expensive. I found a 12 pack of off brand bands in various colors and often wear those, though I will say that they come off my wrist a few times a week, often when I'm doing something like moving laundry. Not a big deal, unless you don't notice it's fallen off and you lose your Fitbit. I'd recommend this product if you're looking to ease into a healthier lifestyle. I knew I needed to head in that direction, and this was an easy, non-threatening way to start.",

What's not mentioned is that you also need to have a data connection or WIFI connectivity on your phone first before you can sync your data and even to log the food you've eaten. Which brings me to another issue I have with Fitbit. Its food database is not very wide and not as easily manipulated like MFP's database. What this means is that Fitbit's food database is very American and British and adding food is not as easy as it is in MFP, I live in the Caribbean and cassava isn't portioned out in grams, ounces or pints; nor is it either served raw or as chips ( I kid you not Fitbit's database has 18 varieties of cassava chips, 3 varieties of cassava flour and as this writing just 2 varieties of cooked cassava). It integrates with other fitness apps great though.",

It seems that the battery has a shelf life of not much more than a year. Rather than replace it again, Fitbit has offered me \"a courtesy discount of 25% good towards the purchase of any tracker\" because \" tracker didn't meet these warranty conditions\". Funny since the product doesn't really meet my conditions. \"Though customer satisfaction remains our number one goal, the demands of running a global business require that we now enforce our warranty consistently.\" It seems to me that, as the company has grown, it's hard to replace tons of Fitbits so, now it can't afford to keep up with the replacements because of their high failure rate. Sad. In sum: Not happy with the longevity of the battery.",

I contacted fit bit customer service and they suggest buying Band keepers or strap keepers to help ensure they stay fastened. So after spending $200 I need to spend more so they do not lose them. I am seriously considering sending them back however I need to come up with a plan since they were their gift from Santa Claus ;( Right now they do not want to wear them because they are afraid they will lose them.

The second one I received lasted about 5 months before not turning on completely. I had high hopes for this product due to all the media buzz but this is lackluster device. I deeply regret buying this device. I would wait for all the smart watches to come out. With those smart phones, they will likely add all of these features and more. Smart watches will most likely make all of these activity watches obsolete. However, these products are necessary to show that there is indeed a market for health tracking devices. EDIT: The device is working again, however, I suspect it is still a battery issue. It takes about 30 minutes for it to charge to respond with any lights. I don't think it will last a day. I'll update more as I see. Updated from 1 to 2 stars. EDIT: This device is officially dead. It does not hold a charge. Updated back to 1 star.

            "review_text": "I am now on my fifth Fitbit device. Fitbit ZIP number 1 arrived in spring 2013 and was lost within 4 months. My second ZIP was lost within 6 months. I received my original Flex in spring 2014 as part of a company fitness effort. Amusingly, ZIP number 2 fell off my clothing within 2 days of the Flex arriving. And, my husband has a Charge, so the Charge comparisons below are based on his usage. Comparison of the three: Battery time: The ZIP has a replaceable battery which needs to be replaced once or twice a year.The Flex has to be charged roughly every 5 days. The Charge may have also taken longer but not by much - a few days at most. Sleep tracking: If the ZIP has any way to track sleep, I'm not aware of it (but you can manually do so from the app). I believe the Charge works similarly to the Flex. Alarm capabilies: The Flexc and Charge both have the ability to buzz at preset times. The ZIP, not being designed for wrist wear, does not. Lose-ability: While I'm quite certain you can manage to lose the Flex (even if it's in the wristband), it's much harder since you can simply leave it in the wristband and wear it 24/7 (except when charging). Similarly for the Charge. Customization: The ZIP can be put in a different color third-party wristband. The Flex has numerous alternative bracelets - different colors, some handmade, some metallic. The Charge and its bracelet are a single unit, there is no way to switch to a new bracelet when the old one wears out - as it will, in a year or two at best. Altitude tracking (i.e. stairs): Charge has this, ZIP and Flex do not. It's a feature that would be nice to have - helps track extra calories burned when climbing stairs versus walking on flat ground - but I don't miss it. Accuracy: Stepwise, it seems reasonable the few times I've tried manually counting steps. Distance-wise: seems reasonably accurate when I've walked a known distance (about a mile). Calories burned: There are articles out there that discuss accuracy of such trackers; I can't judge one way or the other. It's probably close enough unless you need to be EXTREMELY strict about in versus out. Durablity: The ZIP had no time to break or wear out. The Charge's tracker works fine but the bracelet is falling apart. The Flex has now been replaced, twice - it seems like it's designed to fail after a year. The first one lasted 15 months before refusing to sync. Despite trying everything (reset, cleaning contacts with rubbing alcohol, it simply would not connect to my phone or my computer. In FitBit's favor, they replaced it even though the warranty had long since expired. The second Flex worked for about 14-15 months before doing the same thing. Both times, it charged, and appeared to track just fine, there was simply no way to get the data into the cloud. I've just replaced it with my third Flex - we'll see how long that lasts Water-resistant: ZIP, yes. Wearing it in the shower would seem to be a nonissue unless you shower with your clothes on (or opt for a third-party wrist band). Flex, yes (can be worn while showering but not swimming). Charge, yes (though they do not recommend leaving it on in the shower). If I leave my Flex on while showering, I try to make a point of taking it off and out of the wristband for a few minutes afterward to let it dry thoroughly. Appearance: ZIP could basically be hidden by careful placement. Some people use a third-party wristband with the ZIP which allows you to wear it on your wrist - where it looks like a brightly colored wristwatch. A bit larger than usual for a woman's watch but it works. The Flex has a fairly slim band and with replacements, could coordinate with your different outfits. The Charge has a much wider band and is much more obvious - I really disliked it, especially as I also wear a wristwatch on that hand. There are no alternate bands available for the Charge. Display: ZIP has an LCD display that shows steps, time etc. when you tap it. Not useful in the dark but very informative. The Charge has an LED display so you could use it as a wristwatch. The Flex has only a row of LED dots which give you hints as to how many steps, but nothing more than that. You'll need a timekeeping device as well (wristwatch, your phone, a wall clock) to tell what time of day it is, and you'll need your phone app or computer browser to see exactly how many steps. Bottom line: I wish the Flex had a longer-lasting battery. My ideal choice would be a melding of the Flex and the Zip: a replaceable battery, worn on the wrist (the clip-on Zip is far too easy to lose), and with a silent alarm. As there is no such hybrid available, I'm sticking with the Flex for now. If the Zip had the silent alarm, I'd have gone with that + a wristband. The Flex definitely beats the others in terms of customizability, with the wide variety of wristbands both from Fitbit and third parties. Why I only gave it three stars: The short-ish battery life (I frequently forget to charge it, or forget to put it back on after it's charged), and the fact that I've had two in a row die after just over a year.",

I know that it doesn't give me a specific number read-out for steps taken, nor does it report elevation or heart rate. But it does steps and sleep, and for the price, frankly, that is all I need to know if I am moving enough to satisfy myself. The size makes it reasonably unobtrusive, and gives me that \"Yeah - fitness\" cachet. And it gets happy when I hit my goal. I would love more specifics - because I like to play with specifics, not because I necessarily need them. But I am waiting for the general technology of this new industry to come along a little further before I invest in something that I wear constantly close to some main pulmonary conduits. The thing I want to talk about here is this: when I reported the loss of my fit bit, the company responded immediately. They gave me advice about how to find the Flex - a process that actually turned out to be kind of fun and mystical. I don't register complaints often as I move through the product world, but I will say that I have never had a company be so alert and responsive to a review I've written, to be more concerned about staying in contact with its users, to be more warm, polite and useful. There are still some arcane things - like, I have had this product and used it happily for about seven months but had never heard of \"fitbit connect\" nor needed to use it (which is a good thing) in all that time. If I had even registered seeing the phrase, I'd have spared myself a lot of grief in the beginning of this spate of worry. So maybe the basic written copy for this product could be more clear. But the customer service was impressive. So in the end, I have found what was lost, and I can go on with my life NOT feeling like the money I spent was wasted. And I will note that this was the first time the Flex had detached itself in seven months. So whatever problems with bands some other models have had, Flex has been pretty darn great. I am actually terribly sad about this. I bought the Flex just before we took the whole family to Disneyland - and I was eager to see how far I walked while I was there. The truth is this: about the Flex itself: it's simple and basic, but I loved it. I have worn it every day and night since last October 18th (2014) or so, and it changed my way of doing things. I have moved SO much more, because I could SEE what I was doing. I've worn it in the shower and it's been fine. I kind of felt like \"don't leave home without it,\" and it became a familiar pressure on my left wrist. Never had a problem with it coming loose or not working. Enjoyed the computer interface, and even loved the stupid badges (I'm up to New Zealand). But today, I realized that my wrist felt - weird. And I looked down, and the fitbit was gone. Just gone. I hadn't done anything out of the ordinary. I don't remember having my arm under any unusual stress - but the fitbit had evidently dropped off my wrist. My financial investment gone. My little conscience gone. After seven months of continuous and fairly flawless use. In every other respect, I'd give it five stars, because the thing really did give my aging little grandmother life a boost. But if it's this easy to lose (I felt nothing, had no idea it was loose) - then eventually, it's going to be a waste of your money. I can't buy another one. I hope I can find it, but I've looked everywhere. I keep glimpsing the recharger - then I'm sad all over again.",

I am a dog groomer so I assumed I was probably being too rough on them. I glued them back together with super glue and finally had to buy some new ones, which also broke within a few weeks. I was wearing the small bands and even switched to the large ones but they still broke at that junction. Accidently I wore a broken one opposite of what their directions stated...I wore it with the lighted end toward my thumb and the contact end toward my little finger. It was PERFECT and even though already broken almost completely thru, it stayed tight and together for several days until I received my new one. My step readings were also within the same range as before. Since then, I have worn them this way and have had no more broken bands in the last three months. AMAZING!!! I also told several friends who had broken bands about this and they haven't broken any since wearing the light toward the thumb.",

The battery life was very good, mainly because there is a very small screen so it uses less battery. The only problem I had was deciding when to charge it because I wanted to track my sleep but I usually charge my electronics at night so I decided to charge it while at work when I wasn't walking around the most. Tracking my steps and sleep were very helpful mainly because it connected straight to my iPhone. I do wish that I went for the one with the larger screen because it's more interactive and you don't need to go to the iPhone app. In regards to tracking steps I noticed that on the days I went walking with my friends my steps were more than if I walked alone, even if I walked a shorter distance with my friends than alone. I talk a lot with my hands so because the Fitbit tracks motion I ended up adding some steps because of my hand talking. I do reccomend this for someone who is not trying to track every single step they take but for someone who is beginning their fitness journey and wants to set general goals each day to reach. Packaging wise everything was in prime condition when it arrived and it was very easy to set up and connect to my phone.",

At first it was fun - then one morning about a week after I got it, I was on my treadmill for 50 mins. and immediately after, FitBit said I had 28 minutes of activity...? It told me one night, after a good night's sleep, that I had slept only 27 minutes - not restless, that I was actually awake all night but 27 minutes... One night when I couldn't sleep and watchedTV for a couple hours, it showed I had slept 6+ hours. Then one night while getting into bed, before I put the band \"to sleep\" for the night to monitor my own sleep, I synced it with my phone and noticed the number of \"Steps\" I was supposed to have taken that day was increasing while I was lying in bed and moving around. So I moved my forearm in a \"bicep curl\" movement - nothing strenuous or overreacting, just up and down - and while lying bed - according to the FitBit - I took 400 more steps in 15 minutes. I lost my motivation after that and returned it for a refund.",

However, this is a small price to pay for a wrist band that does not make my nickel-alloy-allergic skin break out. I have had my Fitbit for more than a month now. While I won't say the band is 'easy' to snap on, it gets easier. I love, LOVE my Fitbit. Those who object that it is 'just a pedometer' don't understand how much ease of use and ever-present availability of stats on the phone and computer screen can encourage you to be more active. I am not as interested in the 'absolute' of statistics as I am in improving trends. I am more likely to take a few extra steps, or go out and walk up and down the block in the early evening, because I have the fitbit. I am now fully aware of my sleep patterns. I have learned how (pitifully slowly) I, as a 67-year-old female, burn calories. Precise? I don't expect it. Showing me what the zone is and how to do a little better. Darn straight! I think this is a fantastic tool and I would recommend it to anyone trying to up their activity level. Some things I have found out while using the device: 1. Keep your charger handy where you sit (like at your computer) and charge it up while you KNOW you are not going to be active. It only needs a charge once a week, but it is frustrating to be out walking somewhere and have the battery quit. 2. To get the best reading from your Fitbit, make sure you slide it all the way down your wrist (below the wristbone and nearest to your hand). It seems that if you push it higher up your wrist it does not record activity as well.",

They're not 100% accurate, but the food and sleep tracking features are also great. The device doesn't count all your steps sometimes, but I've found when I put the tracker in my shoe while on the treadmill, it's very accurate. However, Fitbit's customer service is horrendous. I had a syncing issue with my device, and it was syncing intermittently but not when I was prompting it to sync. At the time I was using it as my main alarm clock, but I wasn't waking up at the same time each morning and needed to change the alarm nightly before going to sleep. I emailed them after following the steps in the help section of their website. I'm the type of person that does all the suggested fixes, and searches for answers online before contacting customer care. When you file a help ticket, their website instructs you to fill out a form with details like your issue, the type of computer you're using, and your device, etc. The person who answered my query sent me instruction for a PC and told me to check if I was behind a firewall. When I pointed out that I was a Mac user (as per the form they made me fill out), they replied politely, but still didn't give me a useable suggestion...because they took so long to reply that the Fitbit started to sync again by itself. They basically replied that a sync happened at X time, and I should let them know if it still wouldn't sync and if I needed further assistance. I mentioned in my help ticket that my device was having syncing issue all of that week...it's as if they completely disregarded all the information I sent in, and they were answering the parts they deemed fit. My next issue is the bands. I've bought 2 replacement bands since I've had my device, the first replacement within 2 months, and second within another 2 months...2 replacement bands in 4 months suggest the quality of the bands are poor. I've had watches last me for years, and I have a bracelet on my dominant hand that I've worn without problems for the past 5 years. I think I can take care of items meant to be worn on my hand...especially a device I wear on my non-dominant hand, that I do not shower with (even though it says you can shower with it on). Now, I only use the device to measure my steps when I workout, and occasionally as an alarm or to measure my sleep. Funny, but my calorie burn estimate is higher now even though I don't wear the band for half the day (which means it's laying still for hours).",

It makes keeping track of your fitness so easy and satisfying. After becoming so addicted to the fitbit app, I decided it was time to get myself the flex. Once again, they have delivered. The flex isn't as full-featured as some other fitness trackers out there, but honestly, it's all I really need. I no longer have to manually input my runs into the app. It's also extremely accurate. I can actually watch the number go up every time I put my foot down. Couple minor things: - The flex gets confused when I ride my bike. It doesn't count the pedaling as running, but it does go in and out of sleep mode when I'm on rough terrain. After every ride I have to check that it's not in sleep mode. Not too big of a deal but the intermittent vibrating on my wrist while I ride was confusing at first. - The fitbit app only allows you to track you cardio workouts, not your strength. I know strength doesn't have the same effect on calories that cardio does, but I would like to be able to track it anyway so I can monitor the amount of time I spend on each muscle group. I can use a third party for this but it would be nice to have everything in the same place. Hoping they will include this in an update at some point. Since starting with fitbit, I have lost 10lbs of fat and gained 3lbs of muscle!! Definitely recommend fitbit!",

This lasted for a short while, however, the problem started again and so I got a replacement cable. This did not remedy the problem and now I have owned a $99 electronic problem for a mere 18 months and it is not working at all unless I keep poking it with a paperclip. I am so disappointed, as it is no longer under warranty. I searched online for a solution to this and discovered flex charging problems are numerous. In my opinion, the warranty for an expensive electronic that is known to have these issues should be longer than one year. I have exhausted all the suggestions on the Fitbit support page. I am so disappointed, because when this product is working, it is the best fitness tracker I have owned. The dashboard is clean and informative and I loved the idea of being able to change wristbands.",

It picks up clapping and rubbing your hands together but doesn't pick up all of the steps I do when I do ballet or if I am carrying something while I am walking.. I do like knowing how many steps I do hiking up mountains or going for walks. As far as increasing activity it is really up to you to move more. While the Flex can provide some motivation it is ultimately up to you to want to reach your step goal. I paid for the premium service and I stuck with it for a few months but keep falling off the food tracker wagon. If you are willing to put in the effort to keep track the premium service is great for helping you fix your diet and to see where you rank with the average user. The phone app is great for on the go and for challenging friends. I just wish they left it to sync via bluetooth and not with location. If you fight with it you can still sync via bluetooth. If and when my Flex dies I will probably upgrade to the Alta or somthing that also does stairs.",

I watched my two daughters use them for their steps and stairs for about a month first. The eldest mentioned I should get one. They are both half-marathon runners and very fit. I, however, am an obese grandma. We come from a very competitive gene pool, however. My Fitbit Flex has been a real Godsend. It injected me like a huge shot in the rear!! I've had hurt a knee in a fall from work 7 mos. ago, and only been walking about a 1 mi. or so, six days a week. I've recently had to begin using a walking stick to make sure it doesn't give out on me, as I will get a sharp pain about once per walk. The Fitbit and all my Friend List has challenged me to up my game, and within the first week, I was walking up to three times the distance or more. 15 days in, I am averaging 9K steps a day, walking 3.5 miles up to 4.15 mi. a day, taking an easier day on one weekend day, and already have noticed my inches are whittling down. I am tracking food, water, and the program makes it very easy to do. I know it's making me drink more water and be aware of what I eat. If it's not good for me, I still track it, and it's got me buying salads and veggies like crazy, and keeping very little sweets in our home. My daughters, sisters, nephew and friends are all great inspiration, and of my list of 16, I rank between 9th and 12th on any given day. Not bad, as I'm twice their weight, and with some, twice their age. :)) I pray the body holds up on the journey to get me back to my old self. I haven't walked 3.5 mi. per day in EIGHTEEN years~ so that alone is super impressive. I want to get my BMI, weight and body fat ratio down, and be able to play easier with my two little grandsons (get on the floor, carry them up stairs), be able to squat again to pick something up easily, and fit in my bathtub with room to spare! For the first time in decades, I feel real hope that I can achieve my goals. Thank you, Fitbit. I love ya!",

My friends and I participate in a \"Workweek Hustle\" and a \"Weekend Warrior\" challenge to motivate one another to keep moving. I have had my Fitbit for about 1.5 months and I have lost 7 pounds (yay). The only downside to this style of tracker is the clasp on the band. It is a bit tricky to clasp on your own and has the risk of not staying clasped. I lay the top of my hand/wrist on the counter and push the clasp into the inside of my wrist to clasp it.

            "review_text": "There is more to offer from the fitbit than just an activity tracker. At this point in time both my husband and I have one and I've included my observations below. Pros: It's fairly accurate. I use it while synced to my iphone and I frequently take it out and watch my step count change as I take multiple steps. I've also tested it against running in place/ running up stairs and was pleasantly surprised when it came to its accuracy when compared to some other tracking software I've used in the past. It's easy to latch around your wrist, you can easily do it with your opposite hand and without help. You can order additional wrist bands in a variety of colors to fit your style. The fitbit program allows you to compare your progress to friends. It offers weekly/daily challenges between friends to keep you motivated and is very easily to understand when trying to change things like your daily goal. You'll even receive email updates when your battery is dying. Monitoring the quality of your sleep is awesome additional information when trying to make healthy changes in your life. It's fairly straight forward and simple to use. I've even purchased one for my 80 year old grandmother. (Side note, this has worked well from a monitoring stand point. She lives alone, and we're friends with fitbit. I can make sure that she's been actively out and about during the week without having to frequently call on her to check on her. She has her independence and motivation to keep moving, and I have a little piece of mind that she hasn't fallen) Cons: I find it slightly uncomfortable to sleep in. Full disclaimer, I absolutely loathe watches and things latched around my wrist. I've always been this way, so not everyone will agree with this point. I can tolerate this most of the time, but it tends to accumulate sweat at night and I find it a bit unbearable. If you own a rocking chair it becomes INCREDIBLY inaccurate. You can not rock with this tracker. It picks up the movement and skyrockets your step count. As I have a newborn, this was a bit of an annoyance for me. I have to remember to remove it while rocking and remember to put it back on when I get up. Unfortunately, I frequently forget. The bands break. I don't know if it's just my family, but we seem to go through an incredible amount of bands for this thing. Syncing is sometimes a pain. Multiple people in my family have also had this issue across separate computers/ states/ internet connections/ phones making me believe that it can't just be us. All in all I do like my fitbit. I feel better when I'm wearing it and it encourages me to do better. It's a nice reminder if I haven't been as active as I would prefer and I would replace mine if something happened to it.",

So that number is always way off! A pedometer that sits in your pocket or on your hips would be better if you are trying to track steps. I really like the sleep mode. I didn't realize how badly I slept until I started tracking it with this (I do have a 6 mth old, so that plays a big part in it), but also how restless I am. I also like the silent alarm. Since the baby is still in our room, I don't have to worry about waking him up with an alarm. However, I would not spend $90 for a sleep tracking device or silent alarm. The calorie counting and weight tracking options are great, but there are so many free options out there, I wouldn't buy this for that! Being able to sync with my phone is a great option and has worked 99% of the time. I have had this for a month now and the wristband is starting to break at the clasp, I'm going to have to buy a new one so I don't loose it. It is comfortable enough to wear and if you usually wear a watch, you probably won't notice the difference. Depending on how you sleep, sleeping might take some getting used to. All in all, it works as described, so it get's 4 stars for that. I am leaving a star off because of the wrist band. For something that needs to be taken off at least once a week for charging, it should be stronger. I am only using it still because I spent $90 on it and I don't want it to feel like a waste!",

I retraced my steps the next day, checking everywhere I'd been, asking at Lost & Found depts. (I'd done some shopping after work) but I have not been able to find it anywhere. One clerk told me that it was highly unlikely that something like a Flex would be turned in. Why is there no safety catch on it? It would be easy enough to include something like a little o-ring or two to slide over the locked wristband to help hold it in place. Wristwatches come with them. I've filed a claim with Amazon but I'm not too hopeful there. I consider this a major product defect which is why I've given it only 1 star.

There are some thing that are not correct with the calorie numbers so if you are keeping an eye on your calories keep a food journal in a little notebook as well. There is also some products that aren't in the data base and I have sent them the information it asks for and it never shows up. It would be nice if we could create out own food and input the calories manually because I have the label out front of me but I have to go find the closest thing in the database. As you add food into the diary it lets you know how many more calories you have left in the day. You can set goals but it will only alert you on one of your daily goals when you have reached it. I think it is pretty neat that it emails you when the battery is low and needs to be charged.",

            "review_text": "Update 2: I've lowered my review from 2 to 1 star I'm on my fifth tracker, and it's now broken (2 of those 5 were dead on arrival). Not only is software QA poor, hardware QA is nonexistent. The Fitbit support team is abysmal. They don't actually read your support requests. They look at a couple key words, then send a cookie cutter response that may or may not have ANYTHING to do with whatever you asked about. It takes 4-5 back and forth emails until you happen to get someone who happens to read the right part of the message you send to understand why their cookie cutter emails don't actually address the problem you're having. Once that's done, they get about actually offering a replacement product. The only positive thing I can say is that they are so aware of how bad their hardware quality is, they replace the product no questions asked. I had to talk them into giving me a return shipping label for all my broken trackers. I wanted them to have some bad ones to look at so they can get to the bottom of their manufacturing and hardware problems. At least now I have a bunch of extra bands from all the replacement trackers. Update: I lowered my initial review from 4 stars to 2. Here's why: 1. The band only lasts about 4 months. The rubber gets too soft, so the clasp stops staying as secure. the sides also start bulging out around the tracker from the tension on the wristband, and it eventually tore around the plastic part. Fitbit replaced the band, no questions asked, which leaves me wondering if this is a known problem or not. I doubt I'll get another replacement, but hopefully something better will come along by then. I definitely wouldn't trust the Force wristband. 2. Software QA is poor. Their software has been getting progressively more buggy/less stable since September. The tracker no longer reliably syncs in the background, and I've been having issues with setting silent alarms, with the iOS software showing that silent alarms synced, when they actually didn't. The newest update stopped even pretending to work with silent alarms for me. I've tried restarting my phone, reinstalling the Fitbit app, and completely resetting my phone and the tracker. 3. When you email support about software problems, they don't actually read the contents of your message. Having already taken, and having mentioned taking, all their \"troubleshooting\" steps, the CSR told me to do what I had already done. When I responded that I had already done those things and wanted to file a bug report, not ask for support, I got an entirely new person who told me to do the same thing. Original review: I've been wearing a fitbit flex for about a month. I initially purchased the fitbit to track sleep quality. As a geek, I like quantifiable data, and I have a sleeping disorder called \"graduate school.\" I had some pairing issues, but they were due to my own impatience. Response from the fitbit to the smartphone and back is slow, give it time. I can't wear wristwatches because I find them itchy and uncomfortable, but haven't had any problems with the fitbit flex band. I only remove it when I need to charge the fitbit. For the most part, the device does what it promises. It tracks steps, records \"highly active\" time spent every day and notifies you when you hit your goal. Sleep tracking is ok as a relative comparison between nights, but doesn't mean much in the absolute sense. The regular mode is too insensitive and the high sensitivity mode is too sensitive. If you lie still while awake, you can \"trick\" it into thinking you are sleeping. Qualitatively, it tells you whether or not you are giving yourself enough time to sleep start-to-finish and how frequently you're waking up. The duration of awake periods, and how it calculates time spent asleep are a bit dubious. The fitbit software will also compare calories in to calories burned. Unfortunately, their system can only do weight loss or weight maintenance. If you're trying to gain weight, you'll need another tool. I currently use myfitnesspal for food logging because it has a much more comprehensive database and does allow for weight gain goals. I've probably gotten the most constructive feedback from this because it tells me exactly how much I'm under-eating by for my given activity level (2-3 hours/day of heavy activity, 18,000 steps/day average), and I have tried to adjust my lifestyle habits accordingly. In the same time period, I've managed to shave >15s/mile off my distance runs. I don't have enough data to attribute it to primarily diet, or regular training improvements, but giving a number is a good reminder to 1, eat, and 2, pick appropriate foods. I can't comment on the effectiveness of the fitbit Aria scale, but I'd like to pick one up eventually. My favorite feature is probably the silent alarm. It's very good at waking me up without being annoying like audible alarms. Things I'd like to see: The fitbit isn't designed for runners. There are two main issues. First, run logging is poor. The fitbit collects all this data, but when you log a run, it promptly ignores what it measured. The workaround I've found is to set an unnamed \"activity\" between a start and stop time. The fitbit app will pull steps from that. Logging a run any other way results in less real data being shown. One interesting thing to note is that calorie burn estimates between fitbit and runkeeper are extremely close. Distance estimate works reasonably well for walking and for running at the pace you calibrated it to. The distance estimate is close for steady state runs, but is off by as much as 20% for anything faster, like tempo runs or workouts. I haven't done too much research into this I'd like to see fitbit add some sort of multi-point stride length vs cadence model so it can estimate stride length better for runs. One strength the fitbit does have, however, is because it doesn't rely on GPS, it works much better than a smartphone+runkeeper at tracking distances on winding trail runs. My measured distance agreed with the official measurement for a 5 mile trail race within +/- 0.1 miles. The food and exercise database is not good. I use myfitnesspal to track food and activities, but I'd like to be able to use just one smartphone app. Reminders. Reminders to eat. Reminders to sleep. Reminders to move. Instead of just measuring things, I'd like to see the software make suggestions. The fitbit is only effective if you look at the data and attempt to make changes yourself. Fitbit premium (or at least a year of it) should come with the device. I'd like to see a flex with an altimeter like the new Force. I don't want a wider band and don't need a screen, but I'd like to be able to track run elevation. Either better running support or a reminders/suggestion system would take a good product and make it great.",

I wanted a durable fitness tracker, with affordable customizable band options. I decided to go with the Fitbit Flex because: 1. It offers all of the features I was looking for. I don't see the need for any additional (distracting IMO) features like text messaging alerts and caller ID. It tracks activity, sleep patterns, active minutes, syncs wirelessly and you can use the Fitbit App or log in online. 2. After wearing my Flex continually for about 2 months, I found that Flex design is a better choice for people like me. I am clumsy and often bump into objects with my wrist. I definitely noticed when I bump into something while wearing my Fitbit and it makes me very glad I went for this model instead of the Alta. If you've ever scratched up the face of your watch on a textured wall or find yourself bumping into objects, the Fitbit Flex is definitely the way to go. 3. If you search for replacement bands for the Alta on Amazon the selection is quite limited compared to the Flex. The Alta is beautiful and the narrow band is really nice but the silver replacement band on the Fitbit website for example, is $99.95 on top of the $129.95 retail price for the tracker. [...] If you want to \"dress up\" the super sporty design of the original Flex band, The Fitbit Flex Tory Burch band on the Fitbit website is $125 [...] But if you don't want to spend that much you have more in the way of choices with more affordable fashionable alternatives by searching on Amazon.",

Initially, I thought about the Alta, but I didn't think there were enough new features to justify the higher cost and passed on the Charge HR because I've read that heart rate technology isn't totally accurate. The first time around, I wore it and was careful to take it off to give my wrist a break, kept it clean, etc. I still got a nasty dry patch of irritation. I wear watches of different materials and perfume all the time and never had any issues with my skin until I started wearing a Fitbit regularly. The skin on my wrist was dry and itchy and it looked like I had a perpetual and annoying patch of prickly heat. Losing my Fitbit was a blessing because it gave my arm a chance to heal. After replacing it, the irritation was back TWO DAYS after beginning to wear the Fitbit Flex wristband again. I bought a silicone magnetic clip so that I can clip the Flex on the inside of my top or around a bra strap, which helps. Even wearing the Fitbit band loosely doesn't help. I haven't had any issues wearing it in the magnetic clip, which does touch my skin. The difference is that the actual Fitbit doesn't touch my skin--I'm wondering if the irritation is not cause by the bands, but by the fact that wearing the Flex in a band exposes your skin to the back of the Flex itself. GOOQ\u00ae Smart Magnetic Clasp Strap Compatible with Fitbit Flex Bracelet Sports Monitor and Sleep Monitor Wristband (Black & Darkblue & Rose-carmine) I wish that Fitbit would address and rectify these band issues, which seem to be widespread and well documented.

I have had this product for a month now and I really like it! The band snaps on and off easily. Usually I don't like things on my wrist because I have a desk job, but the profile of the Flex is pretty slim and it doesn't bother me. It does a pretty good job about tracking steps and active minutes if you are doing exercise outside. Another perk is it comes with different sized bands and you can buy after market ones here on Amazon. Whereas Fitbit products like the Charge (and the like) come in pre-defined sizes you're stuck with, because the tracker is built in. This tracker is removable which is a real perk for cleaning and charging. A couple of downers about it are when working out in the gym doing treadmill and elliptical workouts, it hasn't been very accurate about counting my steps, so I have to add the exercise manually. I think it has something to do with the accelerometer inside of it, my suspicion is it doesn't know your pace if you aren't \"actually\" moving forward, like you would outside. Another downer is see your daily progress you have to tap the band a couple times, which doesn't bother me too much because I had a Fitbit One. However, I have a 2 month old and whenever I burp her the vibration causes all manner of functionality between viewing my progress on the band to activating manual sleep/activity mode. I also noticed this happens when pushing a stroller on a bumpy sidewalk. I tried to manually track a walk like that and it kept deactivating/activating activity mode every couple minutes. I looked every where to find out how to manually track activities using the flex, but I couldn't find a solid answer. This isn't really a negative on the product, but rather the Fitbit Documentation. Since, on the Fitbit One you just push and hold it's button for sleep and manual activities. I decided to give it a shot on the flex and put it in manual sleep mode and it tracked my activity the same way, which is very cool, but not really documented anywhere. I have read that you can clean the band using Cetaphil face wash if you have one of the color ones. You will need to take the tracker out to do this. Overall, I am really pleased with this product and it has served me so well I'm thinking about upgrading to a heart monitor one.",

Second, I wanted to start tracking my sleep and understand why some days I wake up rested and some days exhausted with the same amount of sleep. The Flex tracks three different sleep categories: asleep, awake and restless. I guess awake is when you get up to go to the bathroom and restless is when you turn over. If you wake up and you can\u2019t go back to sleep and lie very still in bed, it gets counted as \u201casleep\u201d. You are supposed to start and end your sleep log by tapping vigorously on the Flex for two seconds when you are going to sleep, and again when you wake up. Of course, this extra activity is going to guarantee you DON\u2019T go to sleep, if you have trouble falling asleep anyway. I quickly discovered you can log your sleep after the fact, and make your best guess at when you initially fell asleep and got up in the morning. But once you do this it can\u2019t be changed if, for example, your log shows 15 \u201cawake\u201d minutes at the beginning meaning you went to bed later than you thought. I had serious thoughts of returning this for the Charge, which for $25 more gives you automatic sleep tracking plus a display which is present to act as a watch. However, Fitbit\u2019s packaging is definitely NOT \u201cfrustration-free\u201d and the scraps of my box made me think Amazon probably wouldn\u2019t accept the return. I do like the unobtrusive profile of the Flex and the silent alarm works very well. And the sleep tracking does provide some useful information. (I'm not out of bed as much as I thought, and some nights have more \"restless\" episodes than others.) But if I had it to do again, I\u2019d buy the Charge.",

I love that it monitors my sleep too! While it doesn't have a clock or monitor inclines/stairs like the Fitbit Force (it measures them just as steps) it is waterproof (the Force is not.) I keep it on while swimming or in the shower. It does have a silent alarm system that vibrates to wake you up and not your partner (or young child who keeps insisting on sleeping with you! lol) At first the band is hard to get on but as you use it (you do need to charge it up with your computer.) it gets easier and easier, so don't give up! A charge usually lasts about 4 days. I do tend to charge it while I am being sedentary at my desk. What also is really great is that not only can you monitor your progress on your computer, but you can download an app (on apple or droid) to help you keep tabs and update things like water intake and active minutes (what kind of exercise for how long?) or help you add times to your sleep log in case you forgot to turn it on.

This may or may not be a dealbreaker for people thinking of buying a Fitbit, but it's worth bearing in mind for Apple device owners if Fitbit decides never to integrate. I considered lowering my star rating from 3 to 2, but the tracker itself still has a good amount of utility of integration is not an issue for the user. To me, it's regrettable that the data collected by Fitbit (about me) is not freely accessible for me to use as I wish. I'll probably move on to an integrated tracker in the future.

Only way to check one's progress during the day with the Flex, is to sync up with the Fitbit App on one's phone, tablet or computer. It also doesn't sync up to any other fit apps, like My Fitness Pal, where one can track calorie intake and exercise by recording in a diary. It would be awesome if they'd marry the apps to more than one such calorie counter. Only thing Flex has differing from next step up in wristband, is a clock/watch. Even the clip-on One gives time. Had the cheapest Fitbit clip first, upgraded to the One, was gifted the Flex. Wish I could take the pair and trade with Fitbit, for an upgrade to the more informative wristband, only because I personally can remember to put on the wristband more often than I remember to clip a decice to my skirt, pants, shorts. Also wish the device was waterproof and frankly, capable of measuring swim strokes. I don't hate it, one can set the computer to auto-sync, but it requires opening that app and waiting.

It does not accurately count steps when you're on a treadmill, pushing a shopping cart, or pushing a stroller. I do the majority of my walking doing one of these, so it has never been accurate for me. It's so discouraging doing 3.5 miles on the treadmill, to have my fitbit say I went 1.5 miles. Or do an hours worth of grocery shopping to get 100 steps. I have yet to figure out what the activity tracker is actually tracking. I walk/jog 3.5 miles a day on the treadmill, always at the same speed. It has never given me the same number of activity minutes. The sleep tracker was one of the main reasons I bought the fitbit. It's a total joke. I will get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and it never says I'm awake. Again, I don't know what it actually tracks, but it's definitely not accurate. The biggest flaw I've found, is putting it in and out of sleep mode. You are supposed to tap continually for 2 seconds to put into/take out of sleep mode. The problem is any quick movements send it to sleep. Almost daily, I go to check my progress, and it's in sleep mode. I have no way of knowing how long it's been asleep, so I have no clue how long it's not been counting my steps. The one thing I do really like is the silent alarm. My toddler often ends up in my bed, and would wake up as soon as my alarm went off. Now I can wake up early without waking him. I really don't recommend this product. However, if you decide you do want one, buy it from a retailer. Amazon does not take returns on the fitbit. I would absolutely return mine, if I could.",

The slate color goes with most of clothes and she wears it all the time: swimming, shower, sleeping; so it must be comfortable. One of the best things about the Fitbit for me was the ease of enrollment to the program and setup (it did most of it for me); as I am not the most technically competent person in the world, but not ignorant either. Setup is easy, Charging is easy, it provides you all the necessary graphs automatically, navigating through the Dashboard and Logs is easy (she actually has done this by herself a few times), you just have to remember to tap it when you come within 10 ft of the dongle on your computer. Pretty cool in all. Excellent wellness tool; so much so that we will most likely get one for her mother & sister as well. We have the App installed on our All-in-One desktop, Microsoft Surface, and Windows phone; it reads off a central Fitbit website that you log the account onto, but you have to have the dongle inserted in the device that is within proximity to read the bracelet and log activity. We take it with us everywhere!",

            "review_text": "TLDR: A fun product with great ideas and good hardware, but full of software bugs and overall poor reliability over the long-term. I've had this product for about a year and change and am finally finished with trying to make it work for me. The product is enjoyable--when it works. I had one given to me as a gift about a year ago. I enjoyed it very much, though setting it up was a bit of a hassle (why should a bluetooth device need a USB connection to set up these days?). It worked well for about 2 months and then mysteriously died (it would only flash two white dots (usually a sign of low battery), no matter how charged it was). I wasted a lot of time trying to fix it and finally contacted FitBit. They took a long time to respond and made me get a receipt for my gift (always in good taste vs. just requiring the defective item be returned to them) before finally sending me another. That one worked for about a year and now it will no longer sync. When I tried removing it from my device and re-adding it, I found that--once again--I needed the USB to set it up... (despite the updates that added new functionality like automatic sleep tracking, they still can't figure this out?). Forget it... for the amount of money paid, it should not be this much of a hassle. On the positive, the hardware itself is pretty good, though the band material seems to suffer from degradation after about 6 months... The small latch they provide to close it usually works well, but sometimes refuses to close completely and can be awkward to put on. The battery life is exceptional--one 4-hour charge usually lasts 7 - 10 days. Even when the low battery warning comes on (via your cellphone or email alert), it is usually sufficient to last the rest of the day. The app is probably the best feature, as other reviews in the news have mentioned. Challenging your friends is enjoyable and works very well (they even have a taunt option!). Step tracking is pretty accurate, but can be easily fooled... I noticed that sitting in a rocking chair with my newborn racked up an enormous amount of steps when it shouldn't have. On the positive, when the clasp doesn't work for you anymore, simply putting it in a pants pocket works about as well as having it on your wrist. Overall, the product can be a lot of fun (when it works), but I would have expected these kind of bugs and annoyances with a $20 piece of electronics, not with something of this price level. I switched to an Apple Watch... while far more expensive and needs daily charging, it does a lot more and has fewer bugs (and will usually last about 24 hours between charges). I can only speak to my experience with the FitBit Flex model, but I am disappointed with FitBit's lack of quality and lack of care... it's like they took their product and said 'Meh, good enough.' I can not recommend this product based on my experience and would advise someone spend a little more and get either an Apple Watch or one of the better rated Android watches. If you do not need a smart watch and want something to just track your general fitness, a quasi-smart watch (like the kind by Polar or other fitness brands) would be a better choice.",

I bought a pair of them for my husband and myself as a Valentine's Day present, in lieu of candy (okay, I had a couple pieces of candy, too!). But anyway, we've had them since mid-February 2015 and are still getting used to them. They are super simple to wear and charge up fairly easily. But as a person who's consistently worn a pedometer in my pocket, I'm finding that the fitbit tends to be much lower than what my pedometer shows. Not by a few hundred steps, either. So I may have a bum fitbit, I'm not sure yet. On the other hand, it seems like my husband's is over sensitive and counts plenty of non-step actions as steps. It's quite frustrating as he's just zooming around with all these steps and I look like a slug, even on days when we do basically the same stuff. Of course - yeah, yeah, yeah - we could just switch trackers, but the point is - both may be wildly incorrect in their counting of steps, just in different directions. Since I can't really tell, we've decided to bide our time for a bit longer before sending them back. Now - one big thing that seems to work very well - the Sleep tracker part. I love this metric as I really didn't know how much sleep I was REALLY getting. I always thought it was more - worse, I was amazed to discover the time spent awake and restless. So this was probably the wake-up call on sleep that I needed. I want to love the fitbit - I don't . . . yet. I hope I can get it to count all my steps and then I'll love it.",

However, it was only about 5-6 months before the fitbit would no longer charge. It was very frustrating. It just didn't seem to be connecting to the charger properly for some reason. Assuming that it was a just a glitch or an anomaly, I ordered another fitbit flex. To my disappointment, this one stopped charging after only 2 1/2 months. After reading many help forums and talking to friends, this seems to be pretty common. There are all kinds of suggestions out there from using a rubber band to probing it with a paperclip. I don't think I should have to do that for a $100 fitness tracker. The fitbit flex is a little too expensive to be considered a disposable item after three months of use. My advice - either buy a warranty or keep the original packaging...you are going to need it. UPDATE: I called customer service and they were AWESOME! They diagnosed what they believe caused my fitbit to stop working both times - I was charging it for too long. They recommended not leaving it in the charger overnight, but instead - charging just 1-2 hours. The representative immediately ordered a replacement for me and I received confirmation that it was shipped the same day. I changed my rating from 2 stars to 5. They have ridiculously good service.

            "review_text": "I have a few gripes with the Flex. First, though, the good. It tracks activity pretty well and it is fairly unobtrusive on my wrist. When the alarms work they are great, they wake me up without waking up my wife. Now, though, onto the bad. I'm not very impressed with the \"sleep\" part of the Flex. It frequently puts itself into sleep mode. Vibration from pushing a shopping cart, running a snowblower, drumming on my desk or steering wheel, burping my son, or any other activity that causes your wrist to feel any vibration is likely to cause the Flex to enter and exit sleep mode frequently. Every time it does it vibrates, and it gets annoying quickly. The charger for this unit is known to be lacking. There is too much clearance and the flex does not fit snugly in the charger. As a result it will not charge unless it is in just the right position, which is vertical. I don't know about you, but I don't have any vertical USB slots, so I have to rig it up with another cable to hold it in the correct position. Even in this configuration though it will sometimes start charging and then stop as soon as I walk away. If you search online you will see a lot of people with this problem. It is not a problem with dirty contacts or anything like that, it is purely poor design on the charging unit. Finally I have had the Flex randomly die on me a few times. The first time I thought I had just missed the low battery notification. The second time I was pretty sure I hadn't missed it. Just last night it died on me again, and I had checked the battery at 6:30pm and it said it was half full. Just before I fell asleep I realized I hadn't put the Flex in sleep mode, and I tried doing the normal rapid tapping to get it to go to sleep. It wasn't responding, and I realized it had again died on me with no warning. Since I use this as my only alarm clock I had to scramble to program an alarm into my phone. Mind you this was at 11:30pm and I was beyond tired. If I hadn't noticed before falling asleep I would have been late for work. And since the alarm was of course not silent, it woke my wife up. What good is a silent alarm if it might die in the middle of the night? For a $100 item it simply does not measure up to expectations. Follow up: It died on me without any low battery notification again, this time in the middle of the night. I checked the battery level before going to bed and it said it was still half full, so I put it in sleep mode and went to bed. I only realized it was dead when my wife woke me up 30 minutes after my alarm was supposed to have gone off. Needless to say I'm not happy with this product and would not recommend it if you want to use the alarm feature. Fitbit support so far has only told me they are sorry I'm experiencing fast battery drain and gave me charging recommendations, completely ignoring the problem I described in the help ticket. I'm equally unimpressed with their support as I am their product. Follow up 2: After multiple failures to notify me that the battery was dying, Fitbit offered to replace it under warranty. The replacement process was very easy and I'll report back after I get some time to use the replacement Flex. It has gone a long way to restoring my confidence in Fitbit, but we'll see how the new Flex performs. Follow up 3: The replacement that they sent me was even worse than the unit that it replaced, with a max battery life of about 10 hours. They also replaced that one free of charge, and the replacement is much improved. I still think it's pretty sad to have to go through so many units to find a good one, but they sent out a replacement and at no point did they ask me to return the defective unit. Their customer service gets 5 stars, but the product still barely gets 3.",

            "review_text": "Tracker does what it's supposed to do. (See other reviewers for technical comments & comparisons.) The Fitbit app is decent & easy to use. The problem with this Fitbit is the strap (or band) & clasp. First, why package with both the large and small bands? Sell in 2 different sizes (small or large) like with the Fitbit Force, & take some money off the price. Who is going to use both bands? You're either small or large, not both. Luckily, I have a friend who needed another large band. But that is minor. The real problems begin when you attempt to put it on & in wearing it: * It took me 3 hours and a pair of pliers the first time I tried to put it on. The strap is moderately hard, barely flexible rubber. When you have arthritis in your thumbs it is nearly impossible to press the clasp through the band. I understand this may loosen up over time, but it was actually painful to put on. * The strap does not conform to the shape of my wrist. I have a very small wrist and the band tended to \"flop\" around on my arm even when fastened properly. If you have a larger wrist it might fit better. * If you wear it to bed and happen to sleep with your hand/wrist under your pillow, it leaves pressure marks on your arm, even with the band loosely applied as recommended. It is uncomfortable to sleep in. Suggestions for improving the band/clasp system: * Make the band of a more flexible material. * Utilize a different method of fastening. Velcro possibly, or a buckle as on a watch. Alternatives: I have tried 3 different solutions, none of which is perfect, but 2 of the 3 are a vast improvement over the original band/clasp system: * Pocketband.com has a band that appeared to be a solution. Alas, when it arrived it, too, was not flexible enough to put on over my hand AND fit my wrist. Sadly it was $9.00 + $2.25 for shipping & the company only takes returns for incorrect order, defective merchandise, or exchange for size. And the return shipping is on the buyer. * Ribbon Wristband 2-Pack for Fitbit and for Sony Fitness Trackers by Griffin Technology. Made of stretchy ribbon, this band is comfortable, conforms to my wrist and is easy to adjust to size. It slips easily over my hand. 2 problems with these: They are pricey! ($16-$17) The knot, which allows you to adjust the size is hard to undo so that you can loosen or tighten the fit. And the knot is a little unsightly. (Sigh - wish that they, too, would come up with a Velcro closure.) Still much better than the Fitbit band - I can wear it to sleep & not be uncomfortable. * Sleep Sport Band Armband for Fitbit, Misfit, and for Sony SmartBand by Griffin Technology. This is soft, comfortable to wear and is adjustable with the Velcro closure. This is my current first choice. It's only problems are price ($17.30), the Velcro could be a little stronger, and the strap a smidge narrower for my skinny wrist. This is what Fitbit ought to modify or make as their band/clasp system. Very comfortable. Obviously, you can't wear my alternative bands in the shower or while swimming. I'll probably keep the original band for wearing while swimming, but with the other bands, I just take them off for my shower. Seriously, how many steps or how much sleep do you get in the shower? There are also some jewelry type Fitbit bands on the market, but I'm not a jewelry sort of person, so I'm not trying these.",

I can't imagine trying to log my activities and look them up on the dashboard on a tiny phone. I'm really happy that I can see my progress on a full-size computer screen. Finally, I don't need to be told when to exercise or when to start walking as if I'm in an Axis death camp. I like that the Fitbit just tracks my steps and my sleep and I'm welcomed to log other physical activities to keep track of my training. One may even select their logged activities as \"favorites\" and those activities stay in the margin of your screen so that you can just select the activity the next day to log it, rather than re-type the activity into the log. The Fitbit has two metal \"fangs\" that lock into the rubber bracelet very securely. I've not had any trouble with the band coming loose while working out or running through the office halls on a busy day. The whole product is easy to set up and use and you only have to remember to charge it every five days or so. The dashboard reminds you when the battery is low. Easy to use and great to keep track of calories, steps and exercises, as well as your sleep patterns. Love it!",

Before too long, I was charging the thing DAILY, when it should only require recharging every 7-10 days (per the CSR I spoke with today), which further exacerbated the lack of accuracy in recording steps. I researched the problem on the Fitbit site, but none of their solutions solved the issue. I called Fitbit customer service and was immediately issued a new dongle; the representative even expedited shipping. Before switching to the new device, I made sure it was adequately charged and everything worked well for about 5 days. Then I began receiving notices that my battery was low DAILY. Additionally, when I would sync the device with the app, the battery indicator was inaccurate. It would reflect a nearly-dead battery when I had just pulled the thing off the charger! I uninstalled and reinstalled the app as well as checked for updates in case it was a bug in that portion of the system. Finally, 2 weeks after starting use of the new device, and being unable to use it for at least a third of that time, I called Fitbit for a refund only to be told that they were unable to process it because I had purchased the device through Amazon. Conveniently, my window for returning this to Amazon has closed as well. So, BUYER BEWARE: watch your timeframes for returning this to Amazon if you are having trouble, and know that the people at Fitbit are very happy to keep sending you junk but you will not get your money back if your device stops working like the advertising says it does.",

I do a lot of walking at work (school administrator) so when i bought it, all i wanted was a glorified, wearable pedometer to track my daily steps and calories burned. It does both of those things which is a pro. However, the cons outweighed it. First, I had a hard time putting the band on. Latching it was awkward because it's a rubber peg that you're pushing into a rubber hole. My wrists are pretty average, maybe a little thinner than most (I am a size 4), but it actually hurt putting the band on because I had to push it together so hard for it to latch. Twice the band fell off without me feeling it. I think the peg may have worked its way out of the rubber hole because both times it fell off happened in the afternoon after a whole day of wear. The actual tracker itself is a super tiny thing that looks like a flash drive. You have to bend the rubber band and push up in the center yo remove it. I was able to get it out without much effort but putting it in was harder and often took several tries. In order to charge it there's a special adapter you click the flash drive into. If you don't have the adapter you can't charge the device. So if you were to go on a trip and forget it at home you're up a creek. The website says it will stay charged for 5 days. By the first week I started getting low battery alerts at 2 - 3 days. By the second week and a half I began having to charge it daily. The sleep mode works best if u tap and put it into sleep mode manually. I found when I just fell asleep it didn't auto detect l was asleep, though the website said it would. I wish it had come with a manual. Like an actual, hard copy guide. When I had questions or was confused I had to look on the fit bit website (which I didn't find very helpful) or go to Youtube/Google for answers. So, sadly, this just wasn't a good fit for me.",

I found a \"workaround\" to delete this by reporting I was driving during those hours, but it happened again and the same process do not work at all... app is VERY FLUKY... too expensive for these types of time consuming frustrations.

The company replaced it when I gave them a screen shot of my Amazon purchase confirmation. Fast forward to May... Again the new tracker is not recording and it has to be plugged into the computer to even sync up. I contacted the company, did all recommended reset and charged it for several hours. When I put it back into the wrist band, no power! The company told be that I last sync'd on a specific time with full power. But the tracker only recorded a 10th of my activities. I'm asking for an upgrade for frustration sake to a Charger HR. Update: The 3rd Flex Fitbit lasted 3 months before it quit working. It now resides in my desk drawer. Secondly, the band is difficult for arthritic hands such as I have. I was putting it in my pocket which worked just as well. Buy another brand if your looking for good tracker that won't break down in less then 6 months.",

            "review_text": "Fresh out of the box, my Fitbit will not sync to either my iPhone app or the Fitbit software I downloaded to my computer. I exhausted all of the troubleshooting options listed on Fitbit's website, and when that didn't worked I consulted the Fitbit Community forum. Lesson learned, folks. Apparently, this is a pretty common problem. About 40% of customers are evidently able to resolve the issue by doing a hard reset on their Fitbit, but the remaining 60% (including myself) are just SOL. Some of the customers who still couldn't get their Fitbit to pair up with the software accepted Fitbit's offer to send them a new unit, but that seems to be pretty hit or miss too. One customer said he's working on his third Fitbit Flex and he's still having the same problems. Given the sheer volume of complaints on the forum alone, I'm pretty surprised Fitbit hasn't taken more aggressive steps to address this. I mean, a Fitbit that won't pair to any software is useless, there's literally no way to view any of the data it's logging. It's just a rubber lame duck tied to your wrist. Two days after I contacted customer service about my issue, I got an email back from a representative who said, and I'm not making this up, that Fitbit had \"confirmed [my] Flex tracker isn't paired yet on [my] Fitbit account\" and to resolve this, I should follow the link included in the e-mail to setup my Flex tracker on my iOS device. So to summarize: in order to fix the issue of my Flex not pairing to my iPhone, I should pair my Flex to my iPhone. I responded immediately to the e-mail trying to clarify what the problem was, since they didn't seem to understand, but they still haven't responded. Honestly, when it works this is probably a 5-star product, but this level of frustration isn't really worth it. If I was the only one this had ever happened to it wouldn't be that big a deal, but there dozens of similar complaints. I wish I'd done more research on their website and scrolled through their user community a bit before I pulled the trigger. I'm definitely returning mine, and I think I'm going to go with the Jawbone UP2 instead. It doesn't seem to have the same problems, and the bracelet isn't quite as clunky.",

            "review_text": "The Fitbit Flex Wristband is an ideal product that has many features. It can track fitness goals, calorie intake and outtake, sleep patterns, or amount of steps taken during a day. The Fitbit Flex is durable, water resistant, convenient, and comfortable to wear. Durability The Fitbit Flex wristband is made of a rubber material, which works well for the people who move around and may be using their hands a lot. The rubber material also helps protect against water damage, so after a sweaty workout or at the end of day when you are ready to shower, you don\u2019t have to worry about wasting time and taking the Fitbit off. It would be useful for working out in the rain as well. Convenience Fitbit has an app that can be downloaded on any smartphone or can be accessed through a computer. If you are not able to access the app, don\u2019t worry because you can just tap the wristband and LED lights will blink to let you know how your daily progress is going. The Fitbit comes with two different bands that you can change as often as you would like. There are also several colors you can choose if you would like to match the wristband with your clothing. Comfort Wearing the Fitbit Flex wristband is very comfortable. The rubber material is soft and it moves as your body moves. This product is breathable and lightweight. It\u2019s also not a wide wristband so it will not take up a lot of space around your wrist and it allows you to wear it comfortably while you sleep. The Fitbit Flex is equipped with a silent alarm that can be set for any time. It silently vibrates to wake you up comfortably and it will not disturb anyone else that may be around. The snaps on the wristband do unsnap sometimes causing it to fall off sometimes. Overall, this product is a great buy for a fair price that includes many features.",

I've already promised to upgrade her to a better one as soon as I can. While the wristband itself is great - it's sleek, small, doesn't get in the way, it's just so much to get it to work. What I Like: 1. The wristband itself is small and fits very well, plus it doesn't get in the way. 2. My mom loves that it keeps up with her sleep activity, steps, exercise, etc. 3. It's waterproof 4. Seems to very accurate What I Dislike: 1. The numbers don't show up on the screen, it's just flashing lights 2. You have to go through an app just to see how many steps you've taken and all other corresponding information. 3. It seems like she has to charge it very often. 4. Sometimes it takes a while for the app to sync with the fitbit Overall, this Fitbit is okay, but I'll definitely be looking for an improved version in the near future, especially because my mom isn't very tech-savvy. I think she'd enjoy the other Fitbits that flash the number of steps you've taken (as she still wears her pedometer to compare to the Fitbit). If you're someone that doesn't mind going through the app, then I think you would have no issue with this product.",

Once I had it I was sooo impressed, the app is amazing, I counted my own steps sometimes while using it to check accuracy and it is pretty dang accurate. Miles ran match up with what my treadmill and GPS say and the features are awesome. I WAS in love! I basically didn't take it off for five days, until...it ran out of battery. So I plugged it into the charger and NOTHING! It won't charge at all. I went to the website for help, and did every suggested action to try and get a charge and still nothing. I even went on youtube and google to see what other people did and nothing worked. I contacted customer service and they emailed back with some BS generic response outlining things I should try (basically just the list available on their web page that I had already tried in completion). I responded again saying it still didn't work and have yet to hear back from them but when I do I damn well better be getting a new flex because paying $100 for FIVE DAYS OF USE is ridiculous. I love this product so much and am devastated I can't use it now but there are lots of other people struggling with this problem too and fitbit should have resolved it by now so that they are no longer sending out faulty products and waisting not only the customers time and money but their own as well! Update: My fitbit was replaced and has lasted without trouble for the last two weeks. When I charge it (even for hours and hours) only four lights will flash. No matter how long it charges, I believe it reaches a complete charge the fifth light just never lights up. In normal walking and tracking when I hit my goals etc. the fifth light works exactly how it should, so its not like it is broken. I have read reviews that many other people have this same issue. I am absolutely in love with this product but it is little tweaks and bugs like that, that I really wish the company could get figured out! If you pay $100 for a product all of its pieces should work all the time and have a relatively long life. The fact that brand new out of the box these things come with faulty chargers and lights is the only thing that keeps me from giving it that fifth star.",

I especially wanted to document how the chronic pain is affecting my sleep. I was amazed at how detailed the results are with Fitbit. It actually tells you how many minutes you were awake during the night. It shows in graph form how your sleep pattern was. If you were in deep sleep and how long. It counts the number of times I stir or kick. I now know I'm not sleeping hardly at all and the quality of sleep is very poor. The one draw back, I didn't think about when purchasing this item, was that it does drain your phone battery rather fast. You have to leave Bluetooth on in order for it to send the data back to your iPhone or app. But, I enjoy seeing how many steps I do each day while working and it's kind of become a game to try and do more steps each day. I would highly recommend this item to everyone!!! It's a fun way to step up your exercise game and see how you're sleeping and try to improve on both with each passing day. I am still learning all the many things Fitbit can do. Such as, you can enter the amount of water you drink and it will actually tell you to drink more or it says \"I'm thirty here\". You can enter your food intake and it will tell you the calories and then how much exercise it will take to burn those calories off. I know there are many other things Fitbit can do. Oh, also can interact with your friends who have a Fitbit. I find this item to be a very useful tool in my everyday adventures!",

I subtract calorie consumed from the calories burned. I then devide by 3500 ( for a pound ) and it is exactly what I have lost for that week. I have lost 60lbs, and I believe the fitbit flex has been a very large part of that. When I reach my goal weight, I will use it to help maintain the weight.

            "review_text": "Updated Post: I increased the rating because I think the problem was not solely the Flex. We placed the Flex on the charger for an another extended period of time and it started working, again. The previous charge should have lasted longer than one day, but it is possible that the sync between my Galaxy S4 and the Flex was the problem. The Fitbit app on the phone became a high battery user just before the Flex stopped working. It may have been conflicting with another app on the phone because Fitbit and another app that had never been a high battery user were at the top of the usage list the weekend the Flex stopped working. With both being high users, the phone's battery was being drained in half the normal time . After removing the Fitbit app, the phone battery usage is back to normal. This may explain why my wife has not had the same problem with her Flex. Original Post: Received the Fitbit Flex sooner than expected. Setting it up and using it was easy, until the first recharging. After recharging the device it would not work - no lights, syncs or anything. Put it back on the charger for an extended period of time and it started working. It worked fine, including the next two charges, until this morning (a Monday), a little over 30 total days of use. Device had notified me on Saturday that the batter was low. Placed it on the charger and allowed it to charge until all five lights were flashing, indicating it was fully charged. A little over one day after fully charging it, it became non-responsive, again - no lights, syncs or anything, not even a notice the battery may be low. I have not called Fitbit for troubleshooting or service. I may check with them when I have time. This issue is most likely associated with just my product because my wife has a Fitbit Flex that is about a week older than mine and it has been working just fine for her. However, looking at other reviews for the Fitbit Flex, it looks like you stand just as much chance of getting one that works as one that doesn't work.",

It comes with two sizes of wristbands of whatever color you chose. It is so hard to put the wristband on. Two metal prongs must be inserted into two small holes. Imagine doing this one handed! The other annoyance is that the battery lasts only four days. It has to be charged at least six hours which interrupts your data collection. So, that's seven times a month when you won' t have full data collection. If you charge overnight, then you can't record how you sleep on the app. The only useful information I get is 1) number of steps. 2) how many calories expended due to those steps. ( Although I can get that from a pedometer for cheaper price.) Your food and water intake can be recorded on the app, but you do it yourself. It's too time consuming. I should have just gotten a pedometer.",

It's hard to get the connection solidly together and sometimes I found if I brushed it against my clothes or a piece of furniture on accident, the strap would snap open and fall off my wrist. I really enjoyed the tracking app and I found it very useful and motivating in terms of helping me get off my lazy butt to reach exercise goals, but I just can't see myself spending money for a new one every time it starts to have a problem holding a charge.

When is the activity? It answers those questions for me and makes me say, how do I be more active? Sleep Tracking: Works well enough, I have some concerns about it picking up my partner's movment in bed but largely gives a good idea of how long it takes to nod off. Overall it's a decent way to confirm what I already knew, I'm not getting enough sleep. Silent Alarm: Love it, almost worth the price of admission. Battery Life: gets 4-5 Days depending on use which is more than enough; a charge here or there when showering or at my desk is enough I've never really run dry. I do wish additional chargers were less expensive since they are proprietary and I'll dump/give them away if I upgrade to a Charge (HR). Additional: I like that the bands are changeable but they break down with wear and tear if you take out the fitbit regularly (I have 4 colors I rotate trough) and to charge. Again, $15 for a small plastic strip they sell tons of, not convinced but the packs are fine and there are third party options.

But, all good things must come to an end. When the battery died the other night, I went to plug it in to charger as usual and it wouldn't even light up. I cleaned the contacts between the Fitbit and the charger and still couldn't get it to work. When I was able to finally get it to charge (it was left on the charger from 5pm to 9am), the charge only lasted about 2 hours and it died again.

I debated for a long time if I wanted to purchase one of these for myself and I received one for Mother's Day and am now giving them to my mom and mother-in-law for Christmas! There are a number of Fitbits on the market and I liked the Fitbit Flex because it is a simple pedometer that I can wear on my wrist and it is a fairly reasonable price for all of the cool features it has. Even after six months, I haven't been able to play with all of the features that it has but I've definitely gotten my use out of it and really like it. One of my favorite features of the Fitbit is how well it counts your steps and tells you the intensity of your walking/workout. It is pretty sensitive and senses every time your foot hits the ground, even if you are just walking around the house or at the grocery store. I have been amazed at the number of steps that I take throughout the day and I don't even realize it! This feature has definitely encouraged me to walk even more and now it's natural for me to want to get up and move around. There are lights on the outside of the band that tell you approximately how many steps you've taken so far that day which show when you tap the wristband twice (normally there aren't any lights showing until you tap it to check the steps or activate the sleep feature). There is one light for every 2000 steps so when you've just woken up and walked around the house a bit, it will show one light. It will show two lights for steps between 2000 and 3999 steps, three lights for 4000 to 5999 steps, etc. You can then check your Fitbit Dashboard (the program Fitbit uses) on your computer or smartphone to see the exact number of steps, the intensity of the workout, and the number of steps taken between each time period. I also really like the sleep feature. To activate this, you tap the wristband several times until the first and last lights appear on the band. Then you know it is in sleep mode. When you wake up in the morning, you tap in a number of times again until all of the lights flash. If you then go to your computer or phone, it will tell you how many hours you have slept that night and the number of times you were awakened. It also tells you how long it takes you to fall asleep. There is a silent alarm feature you can use so you don't wake anyone else up but I haven't used that yet. When I first got the Fitbit, I wasn't sure if I would be able to sleep with it on my wrist since I wasn't used to it but it hasn't been a problem at all and now I hardly notice I'm wearing it. There are a number of other features the Fitbit Dashboard can do such as calories burned, number of ounces of water drank, food intake and weight (the last three you have to log). You can invite friends to join you via email or Facebook and encourage each other to increase your workouts and goals. The program will also email you when your battery is low so you will need to use an email address that you check frequently. I have found I need to charge my Fitbit weekly and I try to charge it while I am sleeping so I can track my steps during the day instead of tracking my sleep. You charge it via a USB port so I just leave the Fitbit's charger plugged into my laptop so I can easily pop in the Fitbit to charge. The monitor itself is inside the wristband and you just pull off the wristband and pull out the device, which is then very easy to do since the wristband is made of a flexible, rubber-like material. Once it is done charging, you put in back in and you are good to go! The monitor stays securely in the wristband and the opening to get it out is against your wrist. The Fitbit Flex also comes in a variety of colors and is very stylish looking. It looks a lot like a bracelet and you can even purchase replacement bands in different colors if you want to switch up the color. I have the pink color and love it and purchased the black for my mom and mother-in-law. Each Fitbit comes with two adjustable wristbands, one small and one large so they should fit most people's wrists. I use the small wristband and just tried the large one on my husband's wrist. He has a big build and the large fit him with a little room to spare! The only reason I gave the Fitbit Flex four stars instead of five is because the device is supposed to sync automatically when it's within 20 feet of the Bluetooth dongle and it doesn't always do that even when I am sitting a foot away from it. You can manually force it to sync or it will just eventually sync and it hasn't been a huge problem for me. Overall, I think the Fitbit Flex is a great pedometer for anyone who wants to be more conscious of their activity throughout the day. Even if you just want to see how many steps you walk while at work, running errands or just throughout a normal day, this is a nice device for that. I feel it has encouraged me to walk even more and now that I am aware of what type of activity I do on a daily basis, I can figure out ways to improve it. There are a number of Fitbits out there from the basic Zip to the high-performance Surge. Depending on the amount of money you want to spend and the features you want to get out of the Fitbit, the Flex may be a good option for anyone who wants a basic pedometer that you can wear on your wrist. I haven't even explored all of the features of the Flex yet and I am very happy with the one I have and know my families will be happy with theirs as well! I think the price of the Fitbit Flex is very reasonable for the amount of features it has and I highly recommend this product!",

            "review_text": "It's just 'meh'. Pros: There is no fee to use the online tools (unlike some other products), and the dashboard feature online is a helpful way to show you your daily progress towards your goals for steps, activity, calories, sleep, and weight. It's all very organized and easy to use. The bracelet hasn't give me a rash or anything weird, and is pretty discreet. I also like the vibration when you reach your step goal (you can change this to a calorie goal too I think); it always makes me smile to know I've hit my goal and get that little reminder. Cons: The accuracy seems to leave something to be desired. I have a small kitchen that you only need to take 1 big step or 2 small steps to cross. It seems that all the time I spend in the kitchen cooking and doing dishes often results in ZERO steps because my strides are smaller. Also, getting it to go into sleep mode is very annoying. You're supposed to tap it repeatedly for a few seconds, but most nights it seems to just want to flash my step progress (the 2 taps) instead of registering multiple taps. I don't need that kind of agitation before bed. Finally, as someone who works out 6 days a week, I find it annoying to have to track my activity separately. It really can only accurately calculate calorie burn from running and walking (assuming you're doing these on a flat surface). If I do yoga, stepmill, or lift weights, I still have to go in and manually log when I did those things and for how long which sort of defeats the purpose of wearing a tracker. Update 4/17/15: I felt it was necessary to update because I'm finding durability to be a significant issue. 3 months into owning this, the band broke off at the top. Fitbit replaced it, but it took them a week to answer my email and mail it. Now 6 months after owning it the charger no longer works. It's completely dead. I emailed Fitbit to replace that, and got a \"it may not be under warranty\" reply. I emailed them 6 months and 5 days after buying it, so lord help me they better replace it, but either way I'm really disappointed about the quality of the accessories, and it makes me skeptical that the Fitbit itself will last the year.",

The battery lasts a long time and it's pretty durable. My wife had the higher tier option (the Charge) and had issues with it breaking around the band. The good thing about the Flex is that the band (which is the most likely thing to break, in my experience) can be easily and cheaply replaced and you can pop out the actual Fitbit from the band and put it in your pocket if you want (for instance, when pushing a cart in the grocery store). It doesn't tell you the time and steps are displayed in dots rather than giving you the percise number of steps so you have to check the app on your phone if you want to know the specific number of steps you've taken. It also doesn't keep track of the floors you've climbed. To me, though, these aren't really problems and are fair trade offs for the price and small size.",

            "review_text": "I am trying the jawbone up2 now (setting it up right now). I had the shine for about a year. I liked the shine but here are my pros and cons of each, what \"I\" am looking for an activity tracker (not too much!) and what I'm hoping to get from the third tracker (jawbone) I am sure these trackers do more that I use them for. But my main use I'm looking for is 1. steps; 2. calorie counter; 3. physical activity (other than steps); 2. sleep tracking; 3. silent alarm; SHINE - PROs - It has the battery, so I didn't have hook up the tracker every 5-10 days. I like the battery since it's one less thing I have to charge up.. I also like the sleep tracker with the shine, it seemed very accurate. The steps were also very accurate and when I was engaged in activity (I was taking tennis lessons at the time), I had put \"tennis\" as my special activity so that when I hit it 3 times the tracker tracked my tennis. CONS - The Shine stopped synching I thought it was the battery and so I bought several new batteries. Then I turned off / on the application. Finally I emailed the company (there was no phone number) and they told me to do what I had already done. The shine still wasn't synching so I decided to get the fitbit. FITBIT PROS - Fitbit is a sleeker design, which I liked. And I really liked the silent alarm. I didn't realize I needed it until I didn't have it. CONS - I don't like the fact that I have to take it off and on again (since the rechargable part of the tracker is in the strap that needs to be removed. The shine spoiled me to that) I also didn't like that you removed the chargeable part from the tracker bracelet. I misplaced the bracelet several times and -- while that's my issue and I eventually found it -- It's one more \"removeable\" piece. Another con was the sleeper tracker. I want to track the sleep as much as this tracks the steps. Bur with the fitbit, you need to \"place it\" into sleep mode. So some days i would remember (but not remember to take it out) and have about 16 hours of sleep. Then some days I wouldn't remember to put the fitbit in sleep mode at all and I would still have 3 1/2 hours. Jawbone - UP2 - I just got this delivered and set up today PROS - Like the fitbit, this is a really sleek design that I enjoy. I appreciate the fact the there is no \"tracker\" to remove like on the fitbit, so there is one less think for me to lose.And it seems to have a slightly more charged life than the fitbit. Another pro (although I haven't tried it yet), is the sleep tracker doesn't need anything to \"begin\" tracking the sleep. The UP2 also has the silent alarm which is great. CONS - I still prefer the Shine's' battery (when it works) so that it lasts longer than re-charging 7-10 days I haven't done much other work with the jawbone yet, but I thought I would go ahead and add this as part of the review here in case people need to compare. One thing I will say is that the trackers all reinforced my behavior. I was shopping when I wasn't using a tracker and was waiting for the jawbone and doing lots of shopping. I would get home and think \"I need to see how many steps that was!\" It's great for reinforcing behaviour and also would help more if you could get your friends on the same tracker system. Good LUCK! :-)",

YOu have to remember what each of the blinking lights are for which really isn't very difficult. The small wrist band broke in under 6 months and by the end of the 7th month the fitbit it self started acting funny wouldn't keep a charge for more than an hour. I got a new phone and tried to sinc it to the app on that phone and device could not be found is the error I kept receiving. I went thru all the trouble shooting and still nothing. So need less to say the fit bit has sat in the junk drawer and I had to move to a running app on my phone. I enjoyed the sleep sensor and miss that, when it worked for the first few months i really enjoyed it. I am currently looking for a replacement. My husband was looking for a wireless activity and sleep monitor for when he came home from his deployment and wanted a fitbit.

During the first 2 weeks of wearing it, the fit bit fell off my arm 3 times. I am sad to say the 3rd time was the last. I have been unable to find it. I'm not sure if others have had problems such as this, but I am truly discouraged about it. The odd thing, is I had just discussed with someone how much I loved my fit bit that very day. I showed him the app and everything I loved about it. I told him my only concern was the cheapness of the clasp and that I was afraid that I would lose it one day.

It would not track stair climbing, (although that's an advertised feature); would only go into sleep mode intermittently and after 5 weeks would no longer recharge. Since I had missed the return window through Amazon, I went straight to Fitbit. They're customer service was less than stellar, and I exchanged a series of emails with them repeating the problems over and over. Me: The battery is dead and the charger doesn't work Them: Please visit our FAQ's to learn how to charge your Fitbit Flex Me: The Fitbit Flex doesn't track stair climbing no matter how I adjust the fit or even if I carry it in my hand Them: Please visit our FAQ's to learn how to adjust the fit to properly track your progress. Me: When I tap the device to enable sleep mode, it doesn't always work. I can tap it over and over, but it just doesn't enable Them: Try tapping your device firmly 2-3 times rapidly. Really? So after 2 weeks of emailing they finally replaced the Fitbit and charger. Unfortunately, the replacement had the same flaws as the first one, only with this one, it failed after only 3 weeks. I went through the same ridiculous email exchange (I was never able to find a way to contact anyone by phone) they finally replied tonight to say the following: \"Hi Cheryl, We're sorry to hear that our product isn't the right fit for you. We also appreciate your effort in troubleshooting this issue with us. Since you've purchased from a retailer, you'll need to return your product directly to the retailer and follow their return and refund process. This information is generally printed on your receipt, though you may also find it on the retailer's website. Note that we're unable to influence retailer policies. Let us know if you have additional questions. Sincerely, Dan Aldrich E and the Fitbit Team\" Related note: I had the Ultra Fitbit for nearly two years which I absolutely loved. Much better product, did everything it was supposed to and had a nice display on the device so you could see your activity real time. (the flex shows you nothing except some dots - you need to sync your device and log into your Fitbit account to get any details). The clip on the Ultra eventually got loose and it fell of my shorts at the gym. I should have replaced it with another Ultra, but thought I'd try the Flex version thinking that the wristband idea would be safer.",

As a busy mom, I don't have time to worry about taking it off before doing the dishes or anything else that might get it wet, so that was the clincher for me. I received my Flex on New Years Eve, so I started wearing it on New Years Day. It was very easy to charge and to set up an account, and I have had no problem with the clasp. (I just made very sure that both prongs were all the way through, and they have been secure. I love the fact that I am wearing it all the time, and I don't have to remember to put it on or forget where I put it. I am wearing it on my right (dominant) hand, because I wear a watch on my left hand, but that has not seemed to add many steps. There have been several days where I have hit over 10,000 steps (just under 5 miles for me) - just because it is a constant reminder! The silent alarm is another plus of the Flex. I had been using the my smartphone on vibrate, but it would still often waken my husband. This is much more silent, and the fact that it is vibrating on my wrist wakens me even more quickly than the phone vibrating beside me. You can also set multiple alarms, so it can be used as reminders throughout the day. That said, there are a couple of things that I wish were better. First, I wish that I could get more information from the Flex itself than just percentage of my step goal or putting it into (or taking it out of) sleep mode. (You can change the percentage to reflect things like calories burned, miles walked, etc., but you can only choose one goal.) I would like to be able to cycle through those things. Furthermore, I would love the immediate feedback of knowing how many steps I have taken without waiting to look at my computer. (The Flex will sync to some smartphones, but not to my Droid Razr.) Since I am wearing this on my wrist, it would also be nice to have it function as a watch. I really would have preferred the Force for these reason, but Fitbit doesn't recommend wearing the Force in the shower or swimming. As I stated earlier, that was a deal breaker on the Force for me. Another drawback of the Flex (and, in my understanding, the Force) is that steps really aren't counted while pushing a shopping cart or stroller. It is a real bummer to not have my steps counted after a day of shopping for my family! I am going to have to start making sure I have pockets when I am shopping so that I can put the Fitbit in my pocket. It would be nice to also have a heartrate monitoring function, but I'm guessing that will be a part of a future product! All in all, I am happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to friends.",

I was a little nervous with a wristband instead of something concealed and attached to my bra but I thought I'd try it out. So far, so good. It seems to be just about the same in step counts during my normal, mostly sitting on my butt job. One thing I did notice is that I can't wear it while crocheting (I run a small handmade business on the side) because it thinks that I\"m taking steps while working my crochet hook. Maybe I just need to tone down my violent crocheting ways, haha. Since night #1, I've used the sleep tracker, which I didn't with the Ultra because I didn't like the wrist strap on that one.

Not sure what I\"ll use it for in the long run but it's there and I am a girl who likes accountability so this is great for me. Also -- the silent alarm is wonderful.

I never told the fitbit that I wanted it to track my sleep and never set a goal, but suddenly one day it congratulated me for sleeping over 10 hours and exceeding my goal of 8. What was most disturbing, though, was that it told me that I was sleeping at work! So if you just want to track your steps and don't care about specifics beyond meeting 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of your daily goal, then it works fine. If you want to know where you are in order to know if you need to take more steps to meet a weekly goal in the last few hours, forget about it. Another thing that I don't like about the flex is that it keeps track of your weekly goal on a rolling basis. You can choose whether to start on Sunday or Monday, but it still tracks you with the prior week's daily totals. That forces you to keep your own spreadsheet to know how close you are to your weekly goal until the last day of your week. I can't believe that this gadget has been around for so long without the company figuring out that this is really irritating.",

            "review_text": "I ordered a Fitbit cause I'm a bit OCD about my numbers. I really pleased,and am glad I ordered one. In the box, there's a large and small band, the Fitbit itself, the charging cable, and the dongle sync.The instructions are null and void. I had to go online to the Fitbit website to even figure out who to wear it, how to read the lights, how to put the Fitbit into the band. How to wear the band. I had to ask what the lights meant, cause Fitbit's instructions on the website were confusing. I had to ask int he forum. As for the Fitbit itself I love it. Here's how to determine the lights: I use the Android ap on my phone to put it to sleep.I still can't figure out if i tap it a few times, is it asleep, or did I wake it? Snake eyes are sleep indicators. One light is about 25% of your calories, stepping, exercise goal. 2 lights are 50 3 lights are 75 etc. For charging, when its fully charged, there are 5 lights. I don't know why Fitbit would say charge to 60%. I charge mine every 4 days, to 100%. The band is a bear cat. I finally put it on my non dominant hand, and turn the band over, so the clasp is on the top. I can then easily clasp it. I've not had any troubles with the band coming loose, but i did order Bitbelt for it. I take it off to shower, so Bitbelt might not be handy. I'm thinking about getting an alternative band, or making one. I'm pleased with what the Fitbit can do,and amazed with every day. But the lack of instructions, and the band clasp is why I gave it 3 stars.",

I was intrigued by the FitBit Flex, especially the sleep function, so I got one for Christmas. In the short time that I have had it I have noticed that the FitBit Flex is wildly inaccurate on the steps as compared to the Omron that I have because since the FitBit is worn on the wrist it evidently counts every movement of the arm which does not necessarily mean that an arm movement equals a step. For example, yesterday my Omron showed that I had taken 747 steps at the end of the day which is about right since for the vast majority of the day I sat at the desk typing on personal and work stuff and at night watching a football game on TV. As a comparison the FitBit Flex had me at almost 3,200 steps!!!! 747 steps vs. ~3,200 steps is quite a difference. Those arm movements from typing, drinking, eating and some actual walking really raked up the steps! I have a goal of 5,000 steps per day, so based on yesterday's results of Omron vs. FitBit Flex I need to reset my FitBit Flex goal to 21,500 steps per day (5,000 x 4.3).",

I do wish it had a heart rate monitor and a clock but that would be a review for a different more expensive model.This was a gift and a fine one that is very interesting and fun..

Seems pretty accurate for walking but really isn't designed for working out with weights or weight machines. Things I really like: - charges quickly and putting the device in the charger is a snap. - goes about 5-6 days between charges - automatically sinks with your computer so you can see and track results on the Dashboard. - Very light and I don't notice it on my wrist. - I take showers wearing it - It really gives you a good idea about just how active you are - I found that I wasn't nearly as active as I had believed. - Seeing my activity level has really helped motivate me - The sleep tracking is enlightening and you don't have to remember to activate and deactivate the sleep mode since you can input the sleep times manually. Actually, I like doing it that way because I tended to forget to deactivate sleep mode in the morning. Things I don't like: - The band tends to be a little difficult to put on but once you get used to doing it, it isn't too bad. - You have to buy an annual subscription to activate reports. Cost is $50. I use the Windows Snipping Tool to make a record. Sell me a program to do this and I would be alright with it but I don't like the annual fee. I bought one of these for each of my grandsons and they seem to like keeping track of things. Both are into fitness. Some people wish it measured pulse rate but for the price that is asking a lot. I have looked at pulse rate monitors and haven't found any that I think would work for me. I would want something that kept track all day long and uploaded the data into a program with a database. Something that would take each minute and average the count for the minute would be great. The Flex is great at what it does and great as a general activity tracker. I have no problem recommending the Flex.",

            "review_text": "This little device seems like more of a toy or gadget than a serious tool. I think it has some pros and cons, and could be useful if it fits one's needs. I think it's probably good for people who want to know how much activity they're getting in their daily routine, but it's not a comprehensive tracking tool for athletes. Pros: 1. It's fun to use. I have 3 young kids and run a few half marathons a year, so it's no surprise that my Fitbit tells me I'm very active. I like having the LED display show me how close I am to my daily goal. It syncs easily with my old iphone 4s. After putting the Fitbit on and taking it off a few times, the wristband seemed to soften up a little and become easier to latch, so don't get discouraged if it seems to hard to clasp at first. 2. The sleep tracker is a nice feature. 3. Having a goal can be an effective motivator. I can see how the Fitbit would make people want to move more to reach their step count goal. Cons: 1. Could be misleading about how much real activity you are getting. I have days when I don't exercise at all, but take over 10,000 steps because I'm chasing after my kids, running errands, going up and down stairs doing laundry, etc.. According to the Fitbit, 10,000 steps is about the equivalent of running or walking 5 miles. However, taking 10,000 steps while going about my daily routine is not the same -- in terms of calories burned or health benefits -- as running or walking 5 miles straight. I can see how this device would make some people think they are moving and burning more calories than they really are. 2. Battery life. The battery is supposed to last 5 days after a full charge. I've been using my Fitbit for about a week, and a charge only seems to last me 2 or 3 days. Then it can take hours to recharge fully. And it doesn't track activity while it's charging. This detail doesn't bother me, but for people who are really serious about tracking each and every step all day, it could be an issue. 3. My device goes into sleep mode every time I push a grocery cart. Not a big deal to me, but I can see how this would be annoying to other folks. 4. Doesn't \"do it all\" for runners. The Fitbit can track time spent running and calculate calories burned. I understand it can also make announcements while you're running with distance, time, splits, etc., although I haven't tried that feature. However, I still use my iphone while running for music, GPS, and logging my runs. I don't think the Fitbit is intended to replace an iphone, so this is not so much a criticism as information about what it does -- and doesn't do -- for runners. Overall, I think the Fitbit is a fun little toy. It's not life-changing -- at least for me -- but I appreciate what it can do.",

I started noticing it when going on long and purposeful walks and thought it was reading well under what it should have been compared to data I had from a month or so prior for the same route. A quick online chat with Fitbit customer service and they determined it was not working and sent a replacement. The replacement also stopped being accurate for long walks within 3 months. Both still held up, seemingly, for day-to-day things, but my 1 hour walks in the morning were reading at least 1,000 steps under. Talked with Fitbit again and they once again sent a free replacement. Here I am, on my 3rd Flex in 6 months and after 1 week, it is dropping about 1,000 from a 30 minute walk. SO disappointing. I'm done with the Flex but am going to give one of the clip-on models a try because there are so many aspects to Fitbit that I do like. I will say that I have many friends who have the ChargeHR and have never had an accuracy problem in the 1+ years that they have had them. I'm rather disillusioned with wrist based pedometers, though, and would prefer to switch to a clip on one.

The Flex does have these qualities, as well as giving you a nifty buzz when you hit 10,000 steps. However, what the Web site does not mention anywhere, and I didn't see it in the negative reviews that I did read, is that IT HAS NO DISPLAY AT ALL. At least with my Zip, I could tap it at any time and immediately know how many steps I had taken. All you have on the Flex is a line of little lights. For every 2K steps you take up to 10K, you will get a steady light (if you take 3K steps, you will have one steady light and the next one flashing). There are several inherent problems with this: If you have four solid lights and one flashing, you have no idea if you need another 900 steps to reach 10K, or only 50. Additionally, once you reach the 10K, you have no idea at all how many more steps you have taken. To find out, you would have to sync on demand. This feature sometimes works on Fitbit Connect and sometimes not, but either way, I don't have a Smart phone and don't always feel like booting up my computer just to get a step readout. I don't know if I can return this (trying), but if not, I hope it dies soon so I can get something that is actually efficient. Pffft.",

I don't have an upgraded phone or I-Pad so I have to use the USB device that came with it so it syncs with my computer whenever I enter my home. The app is great and it will tell you how many steps you took, how many miles you walked, calories burned, and how many hours you slept, how many times you woke up and how many times you were restless which is good to know.

I have two complaints and when I mean \"complaints\" they are extremely minor. I have had one instance where the tracker actually recorded me taking steps when I was driving a car. For about 5 hours I was getting very small numbers of steps every 15 minutes. It was a junky company car that shakes and rattles a lot so I'm chalking it up to that. It's never happened any other time in any other vehicle. Second is the new update to automatically recognize sleep and awake times. Before going to bed I watch TV and am not active so the tracker believes I've gone to sleep even though its registering (and displaying) a lot of movement and awake time. I have to go back in and correct the data to show a more accurate sleep time when I wake each morning. I believe this will be a fix they make soon to correct the issue. All in all this Fitbit Flex has been awesome and has encouraged me to be more active. I really like the user interface on both my computer and my phone.

I got the Slate color, which I find to be a nice neutral ... it's a little more zazzy than plain black, but I can wear it with pretty much everything I own and it won't stand out too much. One comment -- when I got the Fitbit, I ended up having to Google around to find out how to control the Fitbit manually. (Like, how you can tap it to put it into sleep mode, or to find out how you're doing in your daily step goal.) I don't think the company did a great job explaining that. I also am disappointed that the Fitbit doesn't have a feature for \"smart\" wakeup, where it tracks where you are in your sleep cycle and wakes you up at a good point, rather than just according to the alarm clock.

It was a breeze to set up and the app is so user friendly. The app also syncs with MyFitnessPal so I only have to enter my food once. It doesn't know HR so you just manually put in exercise which is not a huge deal for me. I don't want to be a body builder, just being more active and health conscious as I tone up. I can compete with friends on the app but mostly I compete with myself thinking of new ways to reach 10,000 steps. It motivates me to see the steps and calories being tracked. If I'm tired I check my steps and reaching that goal keeps me going. I also love the sleep tracking. I didn't realize how many times I wake up each night. This wouldn't be good for a seasoned athlete but for the person who wants to be more accountable and active, it's perfect.",

While wearing them, the strap just fell off. I liked how fitbit measured my activity and sync with myfitnesspal. However I have lost two $99.00 purchases for a device that has a crappy wrist holder. I am. very disappointed. For a 99.00 purchase, this strap is crappy for a design. ---------------------------------------------- - 2nd review written on September 17th Update - I contacted the Fitbit support team and was timely answered back within 24 hours. After reading how I've lost my last two Fitbits due to the flimsy wristband falling off, Fitbit will be sending me a new Fitbit Flex replacement at no cost. I was asked to show a receipt for my proof of purchase and since I buy a lot of things like the fitbit online, I had no problems creating a screenshot from the online stores I shop from, so it was an easy replacement procedure! So for this Fitbit Flex review, I have to give Fitbit 5 stars for customer service. I also give 5 stars for the Fitbit Flex product use because it's excellent in tracking calories with myfitnesspal. I use Fitbit Flex daily! However I will be giving it 1 star for product design (yes that sounds harsh, however that lower score raises eyebrows for a reason), because the flimsy wristband is an issue for regular Fitbit Flex users. We shouldn't have to loose a Fitbit, or god forbid, two, in order to discover how the wristband can just fall off. I've worn watches all my life, and none have ever fallen off my wrist, so shouldn't the Fitbit Flex follow the same expectation? Likewise at $99.00 a purchase, for me it's not economically feasile just to buy a new one, if the last one fell. We consumers should not loose a product from a design, which we have no control of, from falling apart. We are not intentionally breaking the wristband, instead it can break over its flimsy material. So I upgraded this Amazon review to 3 stars out of 5 (originally I gave it 1 star, because at the time I was very upset how the Fitbit just disappeared off my wrist, but my review has now changed, and I'm no longer in a nasty mood :) - by still giving kudos to the Fitbit customer support team, and their fairness in providing me a replacement, as well as my daily use of the Fitbit Flex product by tracking calories. Yet I am also withdrawing stars (out of the total 5) to shine a critical eye to other consumers on a potential defieciency with the Fitbit Flex product with the wristband. I also think other Fitbit Flex consumers should investigate the 'O' band. Through Google searches, I've discovered other Fitbit Flex users are purchasing 0 bands, often at Home Depot, at $5.00, which clasp the wristband, and bettter secure it from falling off.",

Second, it does not register steps while used on a treadmill. For example, today I walked three miles on my Nordic Track and only had 1400 steps. Third, the site is difficult to access and navigate through. I have a new computer, and have no problems with Internet, since I can easily access other sites.",

            "review_text": "It took me several days to review this item because I wanted to include every aspect of it. I ordered it 12/27/13 afternoon to night ( Friday ) and paid for standard shipping. ( 3-5 business days ) I checked on the shipping status that night. I was thrilled that it said i'd get it Saturday, instead of Wednesday ( 1/2/14 ) Just like Amazon said, it came Saturday afternoon. I guess I lucked out on shipping because Amazon's warehouse was one hour away from me. In order to view the stats of the Fitbit, you need to use the app or website, so for that reason, I'll review it. The app ( For IOS ) is confusing in the beginning. However, on the other hand, the version for Android is very simple, and appears, to me anyway, cleaner and more updated. They are both copies of each other but some of the layout is different. The Fitbit website is also very complex and is taking me awhile to get used to. Now, for signing up for Fitbit. When I first made my account I tried to enter my correct age, however, for some reason, you need to be 18. I am not over eighteen, so in order to make the account I had to change my age to a incorrect one. On the app I can then go and change my age to the correct one. To the actual Fitbit Flex. Once it arrived, I charged it and set it up with my account, which was all extremely easy. But it took quite a-while to get to five lights. I thought maybe they had changed it to only four lights to mean fully charged. Be patient, it will eventually finish. I've heard many different views about it being Water proof or not. Some say they won't even take it in the shower, some say they take it swimming. For $100 I rather keep it out of water until Fitbit personally says it is safe to take it in the water. The alarm and all that are very cool add-ons, but for $100? In the end, it comes down to a matter of opinion and the amount of money you have. Would I buy another? No. Nothing is wrong with it, but I rather go for a more solid tracker, like a Nike Sports band. I am keeping it, but I'm not buying another anytime in the future.",

            "review_text": "Here's my original review. I've updated it below based on additional time spent with the device: I bought a Fitbit back in September 2013. It worked reliably until May 2014 when it quit charging. I contacted Fitbit and received a replacement device as the original one was still under warranty. After two months of use, the second unit also stopped charging and syncing with my phone or PC. I contacted Fitbit about the second unit that was sent me, but they failed to respond to my inquiry until several days had elapsed and then only offered suggestions as to a possible fix that I had already considered and attempted without success. While I was initially pleased with the device, I cannot now recommend that anyone purchase it. If you do buy one, perhaps you might have better luck with it than I did. I am now looking for an alternate product. The Fitbit was good at recording my activity and I liked the way it kept track of my caloric intake and consumption, but paying nearly $100 for a product that only lasts several months isn't a good investment. Update (January 15, 2015): The folks at Fitbit read the complaints I emailed to them and responded by sending me a third unit. To their credit, this one works. It will actually take and hold a charge, so I'll give them slight credit for that. However, the geniuses at Fitbit then decided to \"update\" their app. Their attempt was a cluster---- in my opinion. Here's what my Android app now does: It double enters any exercise I input into it. If I run for 30 minutes, I dutifully input the data correctly. As soon as the updated information appears in the exercise-logged portion of the app, it automatically copies itself. So, instead of the app accurately logging that I ran 30 minutes, it logs that I ran 60 minutes. I contacted Fitbit support by email and was told to reinstall the app. I tried it; didn't work. I was then asked to send a screenshot of the problem to them. I had already accurately described the problem, but they wanted me to perform a redundant act. I didn't (just a contrarian, I guess). Oh, and in the food-logging part of the app, whenever I had added a custom food, guess what happened? The food was listed twice in the \"custom food\" section of the app. I was then forced to go through and manually delete the cloned entries. In some cases there were three or four entries for the same custom food. Deleting the additional ones was a lovely way to spend a winter evening. I highly recommend it. If you are considering purchasing this device, caveat emptor. If you already have this device and are suffering the same problems I am having, you have my condolences. So my opinion of this device remains the same. However, I do have a slogan for them: \"Fitbit. Not fit for ----\" (rhymes with \"fit\").",

Pushing a shopping cart through Costco? Useless. Brushing my teeth? Man, do I rack up some major \"steps.\" Riding my bike in the park? Not a single number changed. Using the treadmill at the gym where I tend to hold onto the bar more than I should? (I know, I know. I'm working on it but on a treadmill I'm focusing on speed not distance.) Well, my last 2-mile racked up a measly 800 steps. That included the walk to and from my car. In other words, this device just bombs out. Really, you should see my numbers jump when I scratch my leg. This $100 gimmick is just a gimmick. If it motivates you to get moving then it's worth it but if you want it for accuracy then try something else.",

            "review_text": "I decided after many months (who am I kidding...years) of talking about getting in shape to actually make the effort to get in shape. I joined a certain well-known low-cost monthly fitness club and purchased this Fitbit. I love the orange color. It is not bright orange, but still remains vibrant. It is very close to the photo you see on this page. I think it is too much of an attention-getting color though for my office, so I also picked up the slate-colored band. I have average-size wrists for a man I suppose, and I am wearing the large band. I think the small band is for kids, teenagers, or petite individuals. I don't wear a watch, so this is a bit of a change for me to have something on my wrist. It is hardly noticeable in terms of weight though, so you shouldn't worry about that. It would have been nice if thos Fitbit displayed the time, since I am wearing this on my wrist after all. It works great for tracking my steps, and I set the default recommended goal of 10,000 steps. I only accomplished 20% of that goal yesterday, which is indicated by double tapping the Fitbit near the light bar. Two dots lit up for me, which is 20%. I can see this will definitely become a motivator, as I will want to reach 100%. It that way, this is a great device. I noticed it counted about 15 steps during a 20 minute drive home from work, so perhaps my arm movements while driving triggered the counts. The Fitbit pairs via Bluetooth to your smartphone via the app you can get in the iOS App Store or Google Play Store, so don't try pairing it manually via the Bluetooth utility of your phone. You can also pair it to your PC or MAC using the included dongle. I wanted to do that, but my office uses a proxy server and Fitbit's PC software doesn't support a proxy apparently. Regardless, once you create a Fitbit account in your app or the software, the Dashboard on their website shows you a lot of information, such as calories burned, steps walked, etc. There is also a Premium service you can purchase from their website that gives you personal training advice based on data it collects from your Fitbit. Maintaining my daily weight information will be a chore, as will entering the food I eat during the day. This feeling that this will become a chore is the one flaw I see. It reduces the Fitbit to nothing more than a stylish pedometer for me if I don't take advantage of these features that require daily data entry. There are some other features though that might make this worthwhile. These include sleep tracking and silent alarm. I am not sure the sleep tracker will be useful. I tried it for the first time overnight, and found that I was restless three times last night. I'm not sure what to do with that information though. Perhaps change my sleeping position? Try sleeping on the sofa? Maybe in aggregate, it will tell me something worthwhile. The silent alarm works by vibrating on your arm to wake you up. It woke me up, but I also set my smartphone's alarm for five minutes later in case the Fitbit did not wake me up. The clasp is difficult to use the first few times you try it. It gets easier as you figure out how to position it. The Fitbit is waterproof (according to various sources), so you don't need to take it off often. Overall, I am on the fence about whether or not this is worthwhile. I suppose if you understand its limitations and know what you are getting when you purchase it, it may be useful to you. I suggest looking at other options if all you are interested in is a pedometer. Perhaps, I will find more value in this device with continued use.",

I believe a lot of new devices will be released and I wanted something relatively cheap to use in the interim. Now on to the fitbit. It does record activity but I am not sure how accurately. For example over the last three days I ran for over 30 minutes, rowing machine 40 minutes x 2, and cycling for 50 minutes. During those four days I broke the 10,000 step goal twice and have 16 \"very active minutes\", just to be clear that is NOT 16 minutes a day but 16 total for the 4 days. For all of those activities I wear a heart rate and my BPM ranges from 130 - 170, so I am pretty positive they are \" very active minutes \". That leads to the question what is this thing measuring? A few other notes Battery life is good, every time I've charged the device it had at least half a charge. Measuring sleep is not automatic, you have to tell the device you are sleeping either through the app or web page. You can also enter your sleep time the next day so it really isn't to bad an inconvenience. Not really fond of the rubberized band but all these devices use it, so get used to it.

It lets you know in a graph the times you got good quality of sleep, your night of sleep and how long the increments were that you I also like that for very good price you can get ten packs of different colored bracelets that will match many different outfits.

By mid-year, either the notches or the fastener had worn out, and I lost the device. When I purchased my second one at Staples, I was offered a replacement policy which, of course, covered almost everything except loss as a result of a deteriorating wristband. I erred in not purchasing coverage, though, because two weeks ago, my second one conked out. The pod with all the brains in it just stopped working. Silly me, I ordered a third from Amazon, because I'm invested in the software and interface (which are fine). At least the price had come down. But I find this one holds a charge for only two days, compared to four or five for the other two. The product is actually devolving. I sense an attempt get me to buy one of the more expensive ones.

Provide more instructions, as I can't decipher what the buzzes on my wrist mean or when the lights flash; I can't tell when the battery is low.

The only reason I have not given this a five star is that it seems that there is one major flaw. This may not be a flaw distinctly for fitbit but to the entire generation of fitness products. There seems to be a issue with accurately tracking the amount of steps or calories being burned. If you have it on your right hand for example and are typing all day long, or reaching your hand across to grab something from your desk, the movement actually tricks the device into thinking you took another step. Putting this flaw aside, this device exactly does what its original intention is.

            "review_text": "I've gone back and forth between a few fitness trackers... and I'm finally parting ways once again. Fitbit Ultra (+2 replacements) > Jawbone Up (+1 replacement) > Fitbit Flex (+2 replacements) > Misfit Shine (currently) Fitbit PROS: - Tracks a lot of information - Easy to remember to remove before a shower/laundry because it's right there on your wrist. - It's social.... you can cheer on your friends. - Although I won't end up sticking with Fitbit long enough, their Tory Burch line is pretty, which would resolve one of my \"cons\" (nasty looking/smelling band). Fitbit CONS: - When you sweat, the pocket which holds the fitbit gets wet. And then it starts to shut off. Sweat = water, and for a fitness band, this is unavoidable. The fitbit flex claims to be water resistant.... it's not at all water resistant. I never showered or swam with the device, but I expect a fitness tracker to be able to stand up to a 6 mile run. My tracker would die 2 miles in from sweat. - Unreliable tracking. I wore the device next to a garmin wrist worn GPS & there was a dramatic difference. I usually run the same 6 mile path.... I would have different mileage each day when it worked properly. - The bracelet is nasty after a month of wear. My black band is chalky white with severe scratches over the window where you see the lights. It smells bad and has split a little near the window. I wore this everyday for 2 months (until it broke).... second fitbit after it was replaced was pink.... the window is hard to see through & I didn't get more than a month of wear out of this fitbit before it broke, so the look of the band still looks ok, but the window is hard to see through from scratches. This band smells bad also though, even if it doesn't look chalky. I have a friend who wears the same fitbit flex.... it also looks pretty beat. It caters well to someone who dresses down for their daily activities, but it doesn't dress up well & doesn't look presentable or professional for dress up work days. - The clasp started falling off of my flex after about 1 1/2 months.... - LONG wait for replacements. I was a fitbit client for about 6 months, but 1 1/2 months of that was waiting for my replacement fitbit. Customer service was better in the era of the Ultra. - Customer service is repetitive & not personal (not helpful).... when I inquired about the broken fitbit after a run, they would respond back with how to reset the device. This happened 3 times. Word for word, repetitive instructions. I felt as if they weren't processing the fact that their reset and \"fix\" only worked temporarily. CONCLUSION: I think this might be a good tracker for someone who doesn't sweat for their workout.... someone who walks quite a bit for their activities. My mom enjoys hers and she's started walking her dog a lot more. It does NOT work well for someone who sweats daily for their workout.... sweat fills the pocket and kills the widget. If you choose fitbit, I suggest that you own multiple bands so that if you wash dishes, sweat, etc you can put the technology into a new dry band for the rest of your day. I am currently a new Misfit Shine user. I find all the pros with that company (and it tracks MORE information like swimming, cycling, tennis, soccer, etc to boost!) and the accessories to wear or alternate are great - the Bloom necklace is in my opinion better than the expectant Tory Burch necklace. All my cons are resolved.... it's waterproof to avoid sweat-death, more precise with tracking, clean looking (however I haven't had it long, but no visible scratches yet on the metal widget), and customer service is quick. It might not be for everyone, but it's a new brand and I think it will go as far if not farther than fitbit over the next few years. The Shine works better for me as a routine distance runner than the Flex.",

It has been a consistent (as it has for my wife, who bought one earlier) disappointment. For the device to be useful, it needs to fairly accurately report on physical activity. It hasn't, with my trips to the gym I'm doing over 40 minutes of \"active minutes\", driving pretty hard on a rowing machine followed by an elliptical. This device counts about 20 active minutes and maybe 70% of the \"steps\" (the elliptical counts steps as well). My guess is that they designed it solely with walking or running in mind. The device will suddenly stop talking to my phone or the Fitbit site even though its charged. \"Reset it\", they'll tell you, but how many times do I do this before concluding the device itself is flawed. Right now I'm looking at both my device and the Fitbit website who show no activity at all for yesterday, even though yesterday the device tracked over 6,000 steps (the last time I'd checked). Some how, it returned to zero. Pros Lightweight, you'll forget you're wearing it Price point is fair Website and app design are solid Negatives Irregular performance, inaccurate",

I've never seen a piece of consumer electronics degrade in battery life as fast as a Flex. Frankly, it's completely unacceptable. Original Review: I fluctuate between a 3 and a 4. Not because there's anything inherently wrong with the device; it functions well in what it does. But, while Fitbit seems to be the overwhelming leader in this product segment, the small players seem to be a lot hungrier in terms of pushing features on their similar band-style trackers. I ended up going with Fitbit not because of its features, but because I have numerous friends using them, so the social connection could be considered robust. If I didn't care about that aspect, I probably would have gone with a Nobu X by Razer (which, admittedly, seems to have shamelessly copied Fitbit's software wholesale), as it makes far better use of the notification potential some led lights and vibration can bring on one's wrist (at about 2/3rd the price). Fitbit's software is definitely good, though it doesn't appear to sync the battery charge correctly about 30-40% of the time. Initially, it made it seem like I had to charge it every two days, but once I realized how often the battery sync was wrong, and just trusted in the battery, I've been comfortably wearing it all week before charging over a Saturday or Sunday night. Another plus for Fitbit, which had me push it to a 4 is they support Windows, along with iOS and Android. A lot of other companies won't develop for Windows Phone, with a tired excuse that it doesn't have a large enough user base, but it's always wrung a bit hollow with how simple it is to write a mobile app these days. So, kudos to Fitbit.",

Each time I contacted Fitbit support and I was provided with replacement parts. This week the replacement unit broke down after 6 months of use so I contacted Fitbit support once again. I was denied of getting the unit replaced even though I had used it only for 6 months. The reason given was that I had bought the original Flex more than a year ago (1.5 years ago). As a compensation I was offered 25% discount promo code if I go to fitbit.com and buy a new Fitbit tracker within 30 days. Given the poor quality of Flex I would be more interested in changing to the newer Alta model but after the 25% discount it would still cost the same amount than what I paid for the Flex in 2014. So my experience with Fitbit is that you have to buy a new one every 1.5 years and in the mean time every 4-6 months you'll be contacting their support for replacement parts. I would not recommend buying Fitbit. I do like the concept of an activity tracker. Time to look for another vendor.",

I don't swim daily as exercise but this might be a problem for people who do. The clasp is also difficult to work one handed. I am always worried that it will fall off and I won't notice. So far this hasn't happened though. I workout on an elliptical often and the fitbit doesn't register many of those steps. I tried using the moving arm handles and it didn't make a difference. I also have problems with it recording steps when I am pushing a stroller. I found that putting it on my shoelace solves that problem. I do have problems getting my kindle to sync with the fitbit app. I am old school and still have an iPhone 4 which is supposed to work with the app but doesn't.

            "review_header": "Fitbit vs Nike Fuelband - Deciding factors for me", 
            "review_text": "I bought my first Fitbit last year after trying the Nike Fuelband for about a year. I'll do a comparison of the two for those that are considering one or the other: Build: The Fitbit is a little smaller than the Nike and, at least for me, this is a good thing. The fitting system is a bit more granular, with multiple holes available for all wrist-sizes, as opposed to the Nike which, essentially, gave you 2 choices for whichever band size you happened to order. I'm using the larger black wristband, and it fits perfectly (snug-but-not-too-snug). It doesn't jiggle around when I move (unlike my Nike). Ease of charging: The Nike wins out here, since I could just take it off my wrist and plug into any available USB port, whereas the Fitbit requires you to take the small electronic sensor out of the wristband, insert it into the special adapter provided with the wristband, and then plug into a USB port. I've had one or two issues with plugging into a 2.1A USB port as opposed to a 1A, but generally it charges fine. Ease of syncing: The Fitbit syncs via a USB dongle that plugs into your computer or by Bluetooth to your mobile device (I'm using a Moto X on Android 4.4.3). The dongle seems a little extraneous, but I have one constantly plugged into my home Mac Mini and one in my Macbook Air, so I rarely have reason to turn BT on to sync with my phone or iPad. Syncing occurs pretty quickly and painlessly. The Nike, from what I remember, was also relatively painless, but ONLY could sync with a mobile device unless plugged into the USB port. So, while the Fitbit does inexplicably require a dongle, this dongle makes syncing much more painless. Everyday use: I am a pretty sweaty guy, but neither the Fitbit nor the Nike had any real long-term issues with cleanliness on a daily basis. I wore both in the shower, and this (combined with hand washing during the day) seemed to do the job of cleaning them both. The Nike did have more slots and grooves, and I do remember getting some sunscreen in there one day that was a pain to clean out. As mentioned, the better fit of the Fitbit meant that I didn't really notice it around my wrist as much as I did the Nike, which tended to jiggle around. The Fitbit is also a bit flatter, which meant it didn't really get in the way when typing on a computer or doing any other daily activities. Battery-use: Both started with excellent battery life. I routinely got up to 7 days with my Fitbit before needing a charge (similar with the Nike). However, both had gradual degradation in battery life. With the Fitbit, I actually had to get a replacement after 8 months of use since I could no longer get more than 16 hours or so out of one full charge, which meant I had to charge it every night. This also meant that I couldn't take advantage of the sleep-tracking function since it had to be charging. The Nike also lost charge duration over time, but it was slightly less abrupt and a little more gradual than the Fitbit. After about a year with the Nike, I went from 5-7 days/charge to 2-3. Overall: I'd probably recommend the Fitbit over the Nike, if only because it seems to be a little less intrusive in your life. There are many more differences between the two that I'm sure are outlined in other reviews, like intricacies in the software and which phones/mobile devices they can sync with, and I'm happy to answer questions, but these are the main differences which, for me, mean I'd probably choose the Fitbit if I had to choose again. Make sure you order from Amazon, or somewhere with similar great customer service, since I did have to replace it after 8 months, and that was relatively pain-free through Amazon.",

The sleep monitoring did not detect when I went to sleep or woke up accurately. And by not accurate i'm talking about mistakes of up to an hour. I was awake at 6am but it was detecting me as sleep until 7am!! 3. The battery life was not 5 days but 2.5-3 days. It did not give me any alarms when it was running out of battery and also it was draining my cell phone battery as well. Final point does not have anything to do with the product but for returning the product I had to pay for post as well as the seller deducting 10% of the price. Since I'm coming from Germany this was a surprise. We could return stuff for a lot longer time free of charge. Keep in mind the problems with the device and I should have been reimbursed all the price up to two years from the purchase date.",

            "review_text": "Fairly satisfied with my purchase overall. I will say that as some have said, the Fitbit is extremely sensitive to vibrations, for instance when I worked in retail during nursing school before starting at the hospital, I would be pushing carts and the vibrations going through the parking lot would set the thing back and forth between sleep and active mode, negating a LOT of my steps. And as others have pointed out, any time your wrist is in a stationary position (pushing a cart, sweeping with a push broom, carrying something) the flex picks up none to very few of your steps (you can observe this if you set it to constant syncing on your phone). And on the flip side, it counts pretty much anything that makes your wrist move as walking/running, often ridiculously so (for instance if you are using a hammer or boxing, the jarring motion on your wrist just from one punch or a few hammer strikes can be counted as 5+ steps, adding up very quickly). I have found it best practice to just take the fitbit off ahead of time for these activities, otherwise I know i will be forced to constantly reset it to active mode and/or realize my steps are dramatically over counted for that day. I will say that the battery functions better than many have claimed, I have no problem at all getting 7-8 days out of it. I usually charge on Sundays nights (only takes 1-2 hours), but have forgotten and it is still going strong (although it reads low battery) all through to Monday night. One function I don't use hardly at all, and put little faith in is the sleep tracker. Maybe it works well for others but I have tried the standard and the sensitive settings and more often than not it just seem way off. I have timed against it for periods I know I have woken up and walked around then gone back to sleep and sometimes it doesn't even show I woke up during the night, or it goes the other way and shows I woke up for periods of 5+ minutes multiple times through the night when I know that wasn't the case. Overall, its not a bad device, but realistically it could deal with a LOT of improvements. I have used far cheaper belt-clip style pedometers that track steps extremely more efficiently than this device. Also, as others have pointed out, since it doesn't have the other plane sensor (an altimeter I believe, but don't hate if that's incorrect) it has absolutely no idea when you are going up and down stairs, and I've found that despite going up 3-5 flights of stairs it only tracks, if I am lucky, the steps I have taken on each landing...",

            "review_text": "This is marketed incorrectly as a device that tracks metabolism. In reality it is a fancy pedometer- that is only accurate TAKING A DELIVERATE WALK OR RUNNING (it told me I had walked 20 steps while I sat in my chair working-perhaps I'm a vigorous typer?) It is of value if you want to track mileage of walks or runs (think those old Nike wristbands that went with a tracker you could attach to your shoe- except now it's all in your wrist). If you need motivation to get enough steps every day, you can buy a sufficient pedometer for $30 or less that will rarely need batteries or a recharge. Also, it counts aerobic steps the same as regular steps- so that is of no help. If you want to be more accurate by adding an activity manually you should remove the fitbit so it's not counting your zumba session and the steps taken separately. So if you want to track running mileage, well it's going to mess up your other info. And spin sessions or biking can't be tracked. It says so right in the help info. So basically I can get everything except a poor sleep tracker if I just buy a cheap pedometer and use a free app like MyFitnessPal (activity tracker and calorie counter/food diary). It calculates basil metabolic rate based on my info (rather than on real info... just like the fitbit), tells me how many cals I can eat each day to meet my specific weight goals, and adds more calories based on the exercise that I enter. Although the free app graphs aren't as pretty or numerous as Fitbits, they are more accurate.",

If the exercise monitoring was sensitive to something other than arm movements, then what I carry would not stop the calculations of my steps or running just because my arms are full. If the water-repellency was enough to secure the device in pool, river or sea I might be grateful, except it does not monitor arms in swimming motion. The Flex is grand for monitoring the walking of a person unencumbered by armloads of groceries or a bicyclist or recumbent bike rider if the device is strapped to an ankle, rather than wrist. This is only my 4th day, but tests show it is both limited and adequate for certain types of action. Imagining how it would track me while climbing an orcharding ladder (with minimal arm swings but vigorous climbing) to pick peaches, plums and lemons, I cannot suspect it will work well. The memorization of light patterns and fading is essential to understand what the device tells you in the field... unless you are in constant contact with a smartphone linked to the internet interface. The tapping on the device to initiate monitoring of the sleep mode is a very weak method of switching modes. The design team needs to re-think and re-invent as there is plenty of room in this product for improvement and a niche in the marketplace for a device and online system that works well. This product and its software interface is tolerable... but not much more.",

I found it to be very accurate and I thought it was great that you can literally count every calorie that your body intakes. Whether you go out and you can look it up through their app or enter it in manually. The sleep aspect of it is really great too. Always wonder why sometimes you slept better than some nights? The Fitbit Flex tells you if you were either restless, asleep or awake and for how long. Great tracking of everything. The big and major downfall to this product was the lack of the ability to stay synced to my cell phone. My android is brand new this year so I know it isn't the phone. Every few hours I would check to see where I stood on my goals and I would discover that it hadn't synced to my phone in the last several hours so it didn't count anything that I had done. I grew tired of constantly having to check to make sure it was synced. When I first discovered that it was not syncing often I would just plug it back into the charger and just reset it. Eventually I grew tired of that because it happened more often and closer together. Now the Fitbit doesn't even hold a charge and can't sync at all to my phone. So if they could get their product to work then it's great!",

It wears and tears really quickly. i wore mine for 3 days and it looked like I'd had it on for months. Now 2 weeks later? I can barely see my dots light up, it's so scratched. I'm not even doing anything crazy with it. I'm going to have to buy another color, probably black. This is basically a glorified pedometer. I think it would be so awesome if they can integrate a heart monitor into this. Because if you don't run for exercise, I feel like your active minutes and calories out aren't completely accurate. I also really wish you could track progress on macros on the app. The whole calories in vs calories out mentality is outdated- we all know now that all calories are not created equal. Tracking just my calories really does nothing for me. I also think there needs to be a difference between tracking your overall calories out, including just breathing, sitting like it does, and your exercise time. I may burn 1,000 calories sitting at my desk, but that shouldn't be included in my eating calorie budget. I've continued to use MyPlate/Living Social to track my food and exercise instead of the Fitbit app, it seems to be more accurate and I can track my macros (carbs, fat, protein). It's annoying having to use two apps though. The sleep tracking is neat to look at, but I don't think it's accurate. I don't know how it could be- can you not move your arm when sleeping and still be sleeping? According to mine I only get about 2 hours of true sleep every night, and I know this is not true. Again, a heart monitor would be more beneficial.The alarm feature is nice though. All in all, I think this is a fad product. But we knew all knew that. I bought it, because I was curious how much I move every day after moving downtown and getting rid of my car. All in all, I don't really find it anymore helpful in my fit journey than my $10 pedometer and MyPlate or MyWalk apps.",

            "review_text": "I LOVE love love my Fitbit!! I've had the Fitbit Flex since around February and it has changed my life. The biggest impact it has had on me is that it constantly holds me accountable to my exercise and sleep. I have lost 20 pounds so far, by making diet changes, doing strength training exercises, and moving a lot. The Fitbit would not be nearly as amazing without the technology that goes along with it - the website and the app. When I have bluetooth enabled on my phone, my Fitbit data constantly syncs with my phone. I can check the app to see, in real time, exactly how many steps I've taken, how many miles I've walked, and how many minutes of my day have been \"very active\". Within the app or the dashboard of the Fitbit website, you can customize your goals for each of these elements. During my first week with the Fitbit, I just went about my normal life and looked at my data at the end of the week. Then I set my goals for the following week to be slightly higher than the amount I did previously. For example, if I did on average 7500 steps a day, then I set my goal for the next week to be 8000 (500 steps more). Every week I look at my data and set new goals to make sure I am constantly improving and moving more. (By the way, I paid the $50 annual fee to sign up for the Premium account. The Premium part of their website provides you with so much data, weekly reports and graphs about your food if you log it, activities, and sleep. You can also download spreadsheets of your data through the Premium tab. I highly recommend this if you are very data-driven or want to keep track of your progress.) One of my favorite features of the Fitbit is the sleep tracker. Since you always wear the Fitbit, it can track your sleep each night, including how long you're actually asleep for, how long it takes you to fall asleep, and how many times you wake up or are restless throughout the night. This is usually the most interesting part of the Fitbit when I show it to friends. I've convinced multiple coworkers to buy and use Fitbits. Fitbits are definitely more fun when you have friends that use it also. You can add friends, and then within the app or website it shows the rankings among you and your friends in terms of who has the most steps. This is REALLY motivating and fun!! Since getting the Fitbits, we are all motivated to walk more and exercise, partially because we want to be in first place in steps. We also now have a reason to talk about our active lives and what we've been up to, and I've even started working out with some of my friends. It's amazing! I've had people ask me how accurate the Fitbit is. While I can't necessarily speak to its accuracy, I can speak to its consistency. That's good enough for me, because what matters to me is that I'm moving and that I'm moving more every week than I did the week prior. I did very recently start having problems with the battery life of my Fitbit. For the last few months that I've had it, I've only had to charge the battery about once every 5 days. I also set up email and text reminders about when my battery is low so that I never let it die completely. (I don't want to lose any steps or sleep data!) When I recently started having this battery life problem, my battery would drain every 12-24 hours. I tried the troubleshooting tips on the website and then sent an email to their customer service team. They were able to check the system logs and verify the battery life error. After sending them a copy of my Amazon receipt, they sent me a brand new Fitbit package free of charge, and without me having to send in my defective tracker first. I have been very impressed every time I've contacted their customer service team. I also contacted them to see if they have any larger size wristbands. The Fitbit comes with a small and large wristband, but the large is definitely not big enough to fit my dad, who is on his own weight loss journey. After emailing them about the larger wristband size, they got my shipping information from me and sent me an extra large wristband free of charge. Wow! Thank you Fitbit! If you're debating whether or not you should spend $100 on this, I absolutely say to go for it. The motivation and information that I've gotten from this device is worth much more than $100 to me personally. If you're someone that would wear a Fitbit all the time, then it's worth it.",

There are aftermarket fastener rings available; obviously because of this design flaw. This strap should be recalled.. It should be redesigned.so customers are not loosing their expensive purchase so easily.People have been wearing watches for many years without this problem. Why don't they just use the tried and true watch strap?This is a design they should be ashamed of. The technology is something they can be proud of. I have used the Fitbit Flex for 6 weeks. It is easy to use. It is comfortable to wear..It holds the charge beautifully. I think I charge it about every 5 days, The battery has never gone out. It accurately measures my steps. It accurately reflects how i sleep .It has helped me increase my activity and loose weight. I synchronize it with my IPod touch and with My Fitness Pal. I downloaded the Fitbit app and can see an analysis of how I am doing throughout the day. . I love how when I hit 10,000 steps the lights brighten and the fitbit vibrates like it is celebrating. I am naturally sedentary and this tool motivates me to move a bit more. It is good for me. I hope I can find a way to keep this clasp closed to protect it from being lost because I don't have enough money to replace it when this defective clasp opens again. I recommend waiting until they improve the band design before you invest in this,",

On Amazon they suggest checking out solutions to the terminally ill battery on their website which I had already done. I followed all the advice on resetting the device and cleaning the terminals, and saw all the comments from other purchasers with the SAME ISSUE who had no resolution.

The last year & a half, I have been using the FitBit One but upgraded to the Flex because the wristband is more convenient for me than having to keep up with a tracker between changing clothes, showers & sleeping. I LOVE the Fitbit Flex but....the Fitbit website touts that the Flex is water resistance up to 30 meters. I was skeptical about the water resistance & a bit nervous but I thought I'd wear it while casually swimming in a pool this weekend. The pool is only 10 ft in the deepest area & I mainly laid out on a pool float to get some sun. When I got done swimming, I'd pull the tracker out of the wristband, dry the interior of the wrist band out with Q-Tips & make sure the tracker was dry, put it back together & go about my day. I even went through the same drying habit (since getting it 3 days ago) after my daily showers. Well, today I noticed condensation on the screen when I tapped it twice to check my progress; the dots looked fuzzy/out of focus. Figuring that I missed some moisture when drying it off, I pulled the tracker out and swiped the inside of the wrist band & the tracker but everything was completely dry. I tapped the tracker unit while it was outside of the wrist band & realized that it wasn't condensation inside the wrist band, it was condensation inside the tracker, which seems airtight & functional. As of right now, the tracker is working but the fuzzy looking dots are bothering me & I cannot get the moisture out of the tracker... Very afraid that the trapped moisture will lead to tracker failure later. I'd love to give it 5 stars because outside of the whole water issue, the Fitbit Flex is amazing & very very accurate. And so much more convenient than the FitBit One (which I still think very highly of) But the reality is, (to me) the water issue is a BIG issue & is making me very paranoid. I check the device every few minutes to make sure the Flex is still functional & now I don't want to wear it to work out (sweat) or when I shower... I guess only time will tell if the moisture dissipates or is the downfall of this amazing device. Will update post & ratings if there are any changes!",

            "review_text": "After working with the Fitbit for about 3 weeks, I have developed a deep affection for the device but have also learned that the Fitbit under-counts the number of steps by a huge amount. I was interested in - Steps taken - Distance travelled - Active minutes - Calories burned How accurate is this data? Read on to find out, but although the quality of the data is iffy, the Fitbit is a fantastic tool for keeping active. On other issues like setup, sleep anaylsis, web interface and the iOS app (after the latest update), the Fitbit rates very highly. -- Steps taken I tested the step accuracy by walking for 15 minutes, using the GPS in a Garmin to measure distance, and a clicker to count the steps. The Fitbit recorded 1,059 steps, and 0.6 miles, while the clicker gave me 1,707 steps and the GPS claimed 0.91 miles. These numbers show that the Fitbit data is about 60% of the actual data. This is a huge difference!!! I have repeated this test with similar results; in all cases, the number of steps was at most 70% of the actual numbers. I have learned to live with this lack of accuracy by modifying the number of daily steps in my goals; instead of 10,000 steps, I aim for 7,000 steps. How about the number of steps if you log an activity? Below is data for some activities: - Vinyasa Yoga (1 hour): 68 steps - Rowing at 150 watts (15 minutes): 230 steps - Body Pump (1 hour): Varies between 774 and 942. - Cycling at 15-16 mph (1 hour): 3,927 steps - Cycling at 16+ mph (1 hour): 2,750 steps If you equate steps with effort, then these numbers are low (compare them to walking for 1 hour). But this is intrinsic to any device that measures effort via arm movements. You just need to adjust your goals, not a big deal. -- Distance travelled The Fitbit measures distance by multiplying the number of steps by the stride length; if you have not set a stride length in your profile, Fitbit derives one from your age and height. Once I realized this, I lost interest in distance (I can multiply numbers). -- Active minutes The only way that I could get Fitbit to credit me with active minutes was by logging an activity. Otherwise Fitbit is stingy with active minutes. For example, today I did more than 10,000 steps but only got 2 active minutes. Sigh! -- Calories burned What is a calorie? Seems to depend on the person, heart rate profile, and body efficiency. Estimates from heart monitors and other devices vary by huge amounts, so I use them to indicate trends. Below are the numbers from some activities as measured by Fitbit and the data from the HealthStatus site - Vinyasa Yoga (1 hour): 434 calories, HealthStatus 574 calories - Rowing at 150 watts (15 minutes): 127 calories, HealthStatus 142 calories - Body Pump (1 hour): 357 calories, HealthStatus 400 calories - Cycling at 15-16 mph (1 hour): 601 calories, HealthStatus 696 calories It looks like Fitbit consistently gives lower numbers than HealthStatus so you can use this information to adjust the number of calories burned to stay at your weight (or whatever). HealthStatus claims that 2128 calories is the right number for a moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) man of my age and weight, so I am using 2300 as my goal; I may revise if my weight starts changing.",

I've tried all the tips on the web site and nothing works. So it is now a worthless piece of plastic. I sent an email to Fit Bit customer support but have not received a reply. I called the customer report phone number. I get a recording that they are unable to answer at the moment and suggest that I call back. After many attempts, I have yet to find a moment when they can answer. I missed the Amazon return window by 4 days. That's a 100 bucks that I wish I hadn't spent. MY Advice ...Do Not Buy any FIT BIT of any kind. UPDATE: I contacted Amazon Customer Service about this problem. Even though it was beyond the regular return period. the rep made arrangements for a replacement. I just hope that the replacement is trouble free. Amazon gets 5 stars - Fit bit still just one star for now.",

            "review_text": "The fitbit flex is great for tracking normal, everyday activity as long as you are moving forward... Positives: I love the bracelet look and feel because I don't think I could use a clip very effectively. The band is comfortable and fits well around my wrist. I haven't had an issue putting it on myself or having it fall off during use. You just need to make sure it's securely snapped. The charging has been simple and quick and the battery lasts about 4 days, the amount advertised. The app is pretty awesome. I am someone who likes to see immediate results and this definitely gives me that option.The tracking while outside walking or running does seem to be accurate and it makes it fun to try and beat your daily goal. I find myself making more of an effort to get up and move around more, which is exactly what I wanted from the fitbit flex. Negatives: The tracking on a treadmill or while on a stationary machine is non-existent. I typically run on a treadmill and not outside and the fitbit flex does not track any type of stationary movement, despite arm movement or steps taken. The 3D spatial tracking device needs forward movement to properly track your movement so a 3 mile run was tracked as a 1.2 mile run with about 2,000 steps. The way around this is to manually go back into the dashboard and add an activity and input the information about the activity tracked on the machine and the fitbit will make the changes. While this workout is sufficient to solve the problem, it does not seem to jive with the passive tracking nature of the device. I have also found that the app and the dashboard track calories differently. The dashboard will display the correct number of calories burned and the app seems to show more calories or \"projected calories\". The difference isn't huge but when you are tracking your food as well, it makes it difficult to gauge the number of calories you have left to consume if you're just using the app. Also, if you just stand still and swing your arm in a walking motion, the fitbit will track steps, so it does seem very sensitive to that motion. Overall: This is a good device for someone who wants the motivation to get more active throughout the day and just wants an idea of how many calories they burn during a typical 24-hour period. If you're going to use it for running outside or walking, it is a great device to track your movements and get you up and moving. If you want to use it for stationary machines at the gym, I would recommend the fitbit one which clips on to your clothes. It tracks stationary movement more accurately and still gives you the motivation to get up and moving.",

Let me just start by saying I'm and engineer who LOVES gadgets and will really give them the benefit of the doubt when getting them up and running. That said, the fitbit completely exhausted this capacity of mine. Let's start: -won't sync to either of our phones (both are relatively new but Bluetooth version is incompatible) -won't reliably sync to USB dongle -wristband snapped at the transparent joint after ONE DAY OF USE -during USB dongle syncing, the provided software routinely says this is a new device and tries to make us re-setup the device and Crete a new account This product is comprised of three basic parts: 1) the device, 2) the dongle; 3) the wristband. All three of these were either effectively broken (not defective but by design) out of the box or broke after next to zero use. This is absolutely unacceptable and I would recommend 100% against buying this product or anything else from this company as they seem to have no problems releasing products that only work under very narrow (and virtually non-advertised) circumstances.",

            "review_text": "My athlete/gym owner friend loves to make fun of me for buying in on this scam, over-glorified pedometer. I've defended the Flex each time, mainly b/c I enjoy what it can do.. but I'm having my doubts. I admit this is the first fitness band/pedometer equipment I've ever used, so I have no comparison. But I have several complaints. I'll list two: 1. The battery is unreliable. It supposedly holds 5 days worth of charge, but following my initial charge of several hours, the battery ran out the next day after a only few hours use. The same thing happened again the very next time. Determining it was just a factory default battery, I went to the store for an exchange. The new battery lasted much better.. that is, for about a few weeks. Then the problems persisted again. Very frustrating and causes a complete lost of confidence in the quality of the Fitbit brand. 2. I was warned by others that the tracking of sleep is less than reliable.. but the tracking of steps was very accurate. But I'm still trying to figure out how I can rack up 3000 steps sitting in a 2 hour office meeting. Testing it out, several arm swings apparently gave me 50 more steps while sitting. I suppose an arm swing body movement can be equivalent to the effort used in a step, but it does cause me to wonder about the accuracy of its daily count. In the end, the band looks great, and the idea of a goal-hitting fitness tracker is nice. But for $100, just join a gym and exercise. The exercise happens naturally, and you won't need to be so equipment dependent for it to happen.",

            "review_text": "So I got my second flex last week, after the first one was broken out of the box. I can't say enough how easy it is to return defective products to Amazon, very user friendly. Now for the flex. I'm totally sold on fitbit, yes I have a few. . I started out with the Surge. The surge is a great product in its own right, but is too bulky for me to wear every day in the hot summer. If you need all the bells and whistles the surge is the way to go. The surge also costs 250.I needed heart rate monitor sometimes because my health sucks. I'm 46 and I've had 2 mild heart attacks and now have chronic idiopathic pancreatitus. I spend a lot of time in bed, but I still need to do some easy physical activity, which for me is walking. Since the surge was too sweaty and bulky for me in the summer months, I tried the Charge HR next. I really like that one too, but it cost 149..but it's alot less bulky and has a great accurate enough heart rate. But it still got sweaty under the wrist and I was worried about it getting harmed when I do my housework. So then I got the flex.. The flex is very slim and can be loosely worn because it doesn't track heart rate.. Which for me is fine for most days when I don't need all the features. So no sweaty wrist, and, you can purchase many different types of replacement bands to match your outfit. The flex does track, steps, calories, miles and sleep which must be turned on manually. The flex also only costs about 80 bucks so I'm not as concerned about it getting wrecked doing heavy duty spring cleaning. The cost also makes it easy to get introduced to fitbit. The software and app are amazing and very social and user friendly. The app also allows you to hook up different trackers and set your goals up for what you want to do. Having friends on the app allows you to compete and stay motivated too. The flex uses 5 LED lights to help you see how you are doing through the day. Each light represents 20% of your goal. For me, I find the lights more motivating than having the raw data on my wrist because you have to work harder to get all the lights and complete the goal for the day. And, unlike the surge and charge that need to be charged every 3 days, the flex only needs to be charged once a week which is a lot easier if you like me have a crazy busy life.. So get a flex, you will love it and the fitbit community.",

            "review_text": "I purchased this item to use as a supplemental tool to help me understand my body's daily processes in order to overall facilitate my weight loss journey. While I've only had my fitbit for four days or so, I have found that this has greatly facilitated my ability to A) understand better what I am taking in and out of my body in terms of calories, B) be more motivated to keep active and eat right, and C) know when or if I may need to push myself a bit extra. If anything changes as time progresses, I will update this rating. Accuracy: I walk around a ~2 mile lake about 2-3 times a week. The other day, as I walked, I looked at the fitbit app on my phone to see it track my steps live. For every step I took, it counted exactly one step, no matter the pace I was going at or the size of the step. When in the car, I also noticed that it would hardly ever add any steps, and if it did it would only add about 10 or so. Accountability: The fitbit and fitbit app work well with other apps like MyFitnessPal, Endomondo, or MapMyFitness. For instance, it will add in your steps and estimated calorie burn to the MyFitnessPal diary. It also let's you know an estimation of how many calories you've burned and consumed (which also syncs with MyFitnessPal) and gives you a calorie burn goal, which at least for me lets me know if I need to push a little extra. In addition to that, other things like the step goal also just generally motivate me to do more. Activity (+ sleep): As I mentioned, the fitbit motivates me to do more. As I've also mentioned, it works with apps like MyFitnessPal to give me a deeper understanding of what I've done throughout the day. It also lets me know if I sleep sound or if it is sporadic (even though it really just validated what I already knew - I'm a mostly sound sleeper with few movements in my sleep, as I generally awake in the same position I fell asleep in). Last night I actually did wake up in the middle of the night for a moment, and the fitbit did track that as time awake, which was pretty cool. I also like the vibrations I get telling me to wake up or telling me that I've reached my daily activity goal. So far I would completely recommend this product. Originally, I wanted something that would track my heart rate and considered the Charge HR, but I did not want to pay the price and I did not want something with letters/numbers/images on the screen itself as I didn't want to catch myself getting distracted by it or to draw too much attention to my wrist since I wear it all the time, so the Flex was perfect so far for me. I also think it's more cost effective considering the amount of extra features for the Charge HR. A tip: this ships in a large and a small. I use the large and it fits but can at times feel somewhat snug. I emailed Fitbit with my Amazon invoice attached and they have shipped a complementary XL band of the same color, which I will use if I find the large to be too uncomfortable as time progresses or to possibly use on my ankle while on a treadmill.",

When my hand is on the rail of the treadmill or a shopping cart the fitbit does not count my steps.

The two most useful features are that it makes it fairly simple to keep track of my calorie intake, which I have found to be a must in losing weight and weight maintenance. The second feature, of course, it that it seems to give a good estimate of my calorie burn each day. So, for example, if I want to diet and lose about a pound a week, I know that on average, my calorie burn needs to exceed my calorie intake by about 500 calories/day on average. Even though the calorie burn is an estimate, I have found that my weight loss is usually very close to what my calorie deficits would predict. Both the calorie burn and intake require some effort, as there is a fair amount of manual input to get the most accurate results. But if it helps me to improve my health by motivating me to keep my calorie burn up and my intake down, it is well worth the work, to put it mildly. The sleep monitor is nice to have, as it helps me to be accountable to get more sleep. The website has some useful features, such as inputting plans for weight loss, increasing calorie burn, etc. I don't wear the band in the shower, even though they claim you can, as water gets inside the tracker holder, and makes a great place for molds, etc to grow. The tracker can get hard to recharge, as the contacts have to be kept free of oils and skin debris that can accumulate, otherwise, this is a very easy to use device. My first flex tracker lasted about 13 mos before going bad. I purchased another one immediately, as I have come to depend on it. I think it should ideally last longer than this, but still, this is a good product, and one that I can recommend.",

So I switched to the large, which is a bit annoying because it is large, but it still works. So I may have to invest in more bands. Regardless, I have been quite religious about keeping track of my food intake, water intake, etc. And I have quite a few friends who also own a FitBit of some sort so, in keeping track of their progress as well, it also motivates me to do more! And I have messaged back-and-forth with a friend or two and my progress is motivating them! Instead of watching TV sitting down, I have my Gold's Gym stair-stepper and I use this to get in a couple thousand steps. Love being able to track sleep as well. I always wondered how effective my sleep was and this answers that question. My sleep is actually quite effective! Unfortunately, there was a bug with my phone (Droid Motorola Rzr M) when they did the KitKat update and the Bluetooth knocks out WiFi so I am forced to get a new, non-Motorola phone, which is okay because I probably needed a new phone. Of course, the Samsung Galaxy S 5 has its' own fitness tracker band (which basically does the exact same thing as the Fitbit except it also tracks ones heartbeat) but I am hoping the FitBit Flex is still awesome with this phone. :) I am sure it will be. (This bug was not taken into account with the 4 stars; that rating is due to the band already starting to wear out.) I have lost about 7 lbs just watching my calories (I was never overweight in the first place but this will help me to stay that way). I recommend this product for anyone who does not have a Motorola Droid Rzr M (or, apparently, any Motorola phone with the new KitKat update) at least until the KitKat bugs are smoothed out. Update: 13 Feb 2015 Still love my Fitbit! One thing though, never put it through the wash - still works afterwards but runs out of battery within 24 hours. So, I went and purchased a new one! The instructions on how to integrate the two are quite easy. I will possibly give the old one to a friend to try. I have inspired at least three friends to get the Fitbit because I lost so much weight! (About 18 lbs now.) I wasn't overweight; just heavier. Believe it or not, I was still in normal BMI, now it is just a lower number, still in the normal range. I purchased a stepper as well (from Amazon, of course) and I have toned up. My husband thinks it's great and has no problem with my spending habits when it comes to my fitness obsession. And this is less expensive than a gym membership (which is also difficult to get to with my schedule). The daily challenges help me and my friends who challenge me to stay on course and strive for the 15K steps a day. I had been keeping track of caloric intake but turns out I don't really eat a lot of calories so I kind of stopped that. But I definitely keep track of water intake. Living in Utah I need to drink a lot of that. Anyhow, I've rambled long enough. Seriously, the Fitbit will motivate you to take those steps and keep in shape.",

It accurately tracks my steps, sleep and links up with my fitness pal for total nutrition and exercise package. I swim frequently and while it doesn't track my swimming as steps unless I'm going very fast swimming laps I can still wear it in the pool so that when I get out I don't have to remember to put a step counter back on. I also like the gentle vibration alarms, I can get up to work out while not disturbing my spouse with a blaring alarm clock. What really drove me to write this review is at the 7 month mark my fitbit started to act odd. The alarms did not go off when they were supposed to, it wasn't tracking all of my steps and then after 3 days it wasn't responding at all. I got on the fitbit website started a live chat described what had happened and how long I had my fitbit. The response was amazing. They ran a diagnostic verified that my fitbit had several errors recorded over the last few days and promptly told me that they would send out a new fitbit flex at no charge. While still on the chat I received an e-mail confirmation that the order had been placed and was being processed. While disappointed that my fitbit only lasted 7 months I was happy that the company stood behind their 1 year warranty and processed my claim with no hassle.",

            "review_header": "Syncs slowly, charges slowly, ~5 day battery life, bacteria farm inside the band due to trapping water and sweat", 
            "review_text": "UPDATE: The 5 day battery life only applies if you keep Background Sync enabled. I highly recommend turning this off in your smartphone app to conserve battery life. After talking to more people that have used the Flex and Force, they have the same exact complaints about the wrist band. Most of us have switched to the Fitbit One. FitBit Flex The Flex is a water-resistant fitness tracker device that slips into a large or small wrist-band (both included in the package). It tracks steps with an internal digital/MEMS accelerometer, and calculates calories burned based on the user's dimensions (age, weight, sex, etc...) and works well with the Fitbit App that is available on Android and iPhone smartphones. It communicates wirelessly via Bluetooth 4.0 which makes it a snap to sync. However, the syncing is very slow. I've encountered a few instances where it refused to sync and I had to close the app and try again. My wrist measures 6.5\" in circumference, which puts me in-between the small and large bands. I can just fit into the largest setting of the smallest band, but the large band is too large on my wrist. The wrist band easily traps water and sweat. I am astounded at how quickly it will trap water inside the band. I found that if I do not clean it on a daily basis, it will start to smell and grow bacteria. Showering isn't even necessary to do this, simply washing your hands will cause water to become trapped and make squishy noises. The battery life is advertised at 5 days and that is about what I am seeing. It takes quite a long time to fully charge up, even when using a 10W / 2A Belkin charger. There aren't any real helpful instructions upfront for calibrating the stride distance, so the first few times I went for a jog to compare the Flex against my MotoACTV and Garmin Footpod, the distances were off but the number of steps matched almost perfectly. The Garmin Footpod also uses a digital/MEMS accelerometer to track steps but it is actually tied to a shoe for the ultimate in precision. Once I entered my correct stride distances, the running mileage recorded by the Flex matched that of the GPS in the MotoACTV. The amount of calories burned is calculated higher with the Flex than the MotoACTV. The sleep tracking is neat, but it basically detects how often you move your hand while sleeping. I found myself trying not to move while sleeping to \"boost\" my sleep efficiency score, but the band never felt uncomfortable. Entering and exiting sleep mode takes some practice because it is very finicky. However, when it comes to riding my bicycle or working in the garage with a hammer, it somehow loves to enter and exit sleep mode due to the vibrations it detects through my hand. The Flex is totally useless while riding a bicycle and I imagine it isn't going to be very useful while swimming. While riding the bike, the Flex became unresponsive to actual taps. It somehow wouldn't detect my taps, no matter how much force I applied. Even when golfing, it started to enter/exit sleep mode. A friend gently grabbed my wrist to look at the Flex and it started blinking the status LED for how much I've walked. The Jawbone app looks more appealing graphically. I find that I have to use the FitBit web portal to log most of my activities more easily than the bland app. My biggest complaints are that the battery life isn't easily monitored. When my battery was low, I never received an email or notification. It takes 2 hours or more to fully charge, and it syncs very slowly. The wristband and Flex are water resistant, but the band traps water and sweat inside the cavity that holds the Flex. Washing hands, taking a shower, and sweating will result in a plethora of bacteria building up inside the band. I'm sure over time the band will stretch or deform to the point it won't hold the Flex as tightly. Replacement bands are available at a relatively high price. The metal clasp can easily fall out of the band. If you lose it or break it, replacement clasps are available, but it can be a pain to lose such a small item when you're trying to adjust the strap. Overall: 3/5 stars, basically a pedometer that attaches to wrist and can transmit data via wireless to a smartphone. It's water resistant, but you have to constantly clean the sensor and band or else it will grow bacteria. I can understand why they designed it this way, I just found the overall execution to be lacking. It works, don't get me wrong, I Just didn't care for the app or the method of logging my activities and how I need to take it off before working in the garage or riding a bicycle or anything that involves vibrations which might trip the sensor into thinking it is going into sleep mode.",

I quickly learned that the company is well aware of the fact that their clasp fails quite often and that many Fitbit Flex users have experienced a lost device (including several of my friends who have had similar experiences!). The company could so easily fix this problem by providing an inexpensive silicon band (which I eventually had to purchase) to secure the device; however, they apparently don't care enough about their customers' $100 investments. Although the company was willing to replace the lost device, it took nearly a month for that to happen and the new Fitbit Flex they sent began having technical problems within two months of receiving it (although I should feel lucky, since a friend of mine received a replacement Fitbit Flex that didn't work at all). When I contacted the company about this new malfunction, I was told that my original warranty had expired and that there was nothing they would do for me. There was no acknowledgement that I was talking about the new device having failed. At this point, I'm done with Fitbit. I'm planning on move up to a better product backed by a better company!",

BUT, Flex has multiple issues: mine has counted steps I did not take, when I was not in a vehicle but sedentary. Not just a few but several days of 30,000+. Yikes. I wish! Lately it has no LED light display and fails to Update steps through any of my usual means. The help desk (see more below) says they can see steps updating but have nothing more to offer. Am I to file a HelpDesk report to ask, \"How am I doing today? Have I hit 10,000 steps yet? So the HelpDesk aka Hector and team have no help for those of us wanting to stay with the Flex and FitBit. I am one of those compulsive consumers who reads the manual, and works through all of the self help process BEFORE asking for help. Usually Help Desk replies spout back what is on the self help guide and seems not to read what the customer identifies as the problem. So now: my FitBit Flex does not count steps accurately; counts steps when neither it or wearer are moving; does not update the site so wearer can see; and the Help Desk is no help.

The syncing is easy and provides lots of interesting and informative data, that I can also view on my phone app. The sleep data is useful, and the \"dashboard\" display is easy to read, colorful, and useful. I love watching my progress and getting the \"Hooray!\" celebrations when I hit goals. The FitBit data syncs with my food-tracking program (the free My Fitness Pal app), which is a great plus as it allows me to track both calories in and calories out. Pros: comfortable, easy to use, good data, the fact that I can swap the wristband colors and the motivation!! Cons: there is no 'dressy' wristband option, the Flex doesn't count stairs, and it's sometimes tricky to put it into sleep mode.",

            "review_text": "Purchased the flex a month a go and have been using it daily since. I have been happy with it until today. First, I have been trying to lose weight and with the information this provides, it has helped me to be more concious of what I eat and how active I am. First off, this is not magic device that will guarantee you lose weight. It provides information and the motivation, the determination comes from you. It tracks your activity level (number of steps - not stairsteps climbed though) to a reasonable degree of accuracy. I took a short walk with phone in one hand and the fitbit flex on the other. The counter increased for every step I took, walking, running and jogging. I'm sure its not 100% accurate but maybe with 5% margin for error. You can interact with the fitbit by taps or a bluetooth smart phone (Apple or Android) or through your PC via the included USB dongle. Two taps on the flex activates up to 5 white led lights to show how much of the goal you set has been achieved for the day, 20% per led light. This can be set to display goals through the app - calories burned, steps taken, distance traveled etc. The flex vibrates when you achieve a daily goal. By steadily tapping it 5x, the lights flash to indicate it is starting to track your sleep pattern (you can initiate this through your phone too). Although I keep forgetting to do this and I am not really interested in tracking my sleep. The few times i tried it though, I got data about my restless times and time I woke up during the night. Don't know what to make of it or what use it is for though. One of the features I love is the vibrating alarm. Set it on your phone and the flex will vibrate at the correct time to wake you and not the person beside you. Great for couples who have to be up at different times and an alarm clock/phone is an unwelcome intrusion into your partner's sleep. For the guys who had to get up earlier than their girlfriends, the fitbit is worth it if just for saving you from a sleep deprived PMS induced rage a couple of times a month. There is a meal tracker built in the app and it has a pretty extensive database plus the ability to input custom food. Input what you eat from there so the app can compare your calories eaten and burned - the flex tracks the burned calories and is synced to your phone. I have been targeting a calorie deficit of around 1000 calories a day. It is still a hit and miss affair - I love to eat and I can't believe how many calories there are in a pizza. But with this info i have shed 10 lbs since I started using this. Now the bad part, I obviously love my flex but the strap broke after a month. The transparent window for the fitbit flex lights separated from the rubber/silicone strap. I am not an overly active person. I used it in the gym once - to track the distance traveled it measured vs the treadmill (it was within 1/10 over a 3km run). And I took the fitbit device out maybe 4 or 5 times for charging. So I am a little pissed it's broken. The thing that grinds my gears though is the replacement straps are on back order on the fitbit.com website, 8-10 weeks and some jerk is selling them at USD100 for a 3pack here at amazon vs USD30ish for 3 from fitbit. I hope instead of sending me a large AND small strap with the flex (i ordered large) they should have sent me 2 large straps. At least I can still use it while waiting for the back ordered replacements. UPDATE: Fitbit emailed me after I placed my order in their website for the replacement straps to confirm it in line with their security policies. i requested them to cancel it since the 8-10 week waiting period is too long for me as I have located a local seller carrying the strap and I sent them photos of my damaged strap just to show them the issue and hopefully address it in future versions of the product. They offered to replace the strap without me requesting, demanding or even hinting for it. Kudos to Kate and the rest of fitbit.com's support team. I am adding another star for the hassle free interaction with fitbit support. Hopefully the other star will be added if and when the future straps holds up to daily use. 4 stars for functionality but I am taking off 2 stars due to durability issues and difficulty in getting replacements. I updated the review to 3 stars to give credit to the fast response by the fitbit.com support team.",

It is very comfortable, and much harder to lose than the pedometer I wore on my belt. It syncs to the online fitness tracker my company is using You can change the color of the band to match what you're wearing The buzzer when you get to your goal is pretty cool and kind of fun The alarm function is pretty useful - it doesn't really wake me up, but if I'm thinking about getting up and just not moving, it reminds me that it's time to get up Cons: I wish it had a watch I wish it gave the actual steps, instead of dots that tell me that I am somewhere in a range of 2,000 steps. The charger is proprietary. When I lose it, I'm going to have to buy another one, but it would be preferable to be able to use my phone charger. It would be good if it could go longer without needing to be charged It will not sync to my smartphone (it's an older smartphone). I have to have the dongle and a computer with an internet connection to read my steps. One day, I logged 9,990 steps. If I'd have known, I'd have gotten to 10,000 that day! Fitbit needs to come out with a \"formal\" band that would look right on more formal occasions, or at work. Overall, it's well worth the price and I am glad I bought one.

When I checked their help forums many people have the problem with the Flex not holding a charge and they a few guesses as to why the battery fails but nothing from Fitbit confirms or denies anyone's guesses. I contacted their support and they were able to confirm that the Flex was not holding a charge. It seems that the charging information is stored in their database and they can access it as needed. This facilitated the replacement of the device and I got the new one in about a week. They told me to switch my account to the new Flex and then to simply recycle the old one at a local facility. Their support was prompt and friendly. The new Flex worked fine for about two weeks but it too has failed and will only hold a charge for 24-28 hours. I have contacted their support a second time about this problem but as of now I have not heard back from them.

We've done this by utilizing the activity monitor, steps monitor, sleep tracker, water tracker, and, most importantly, the food journal/calorie tracker. We love it because of the awareness, but if you don't use the app for all its advantages then it might end up becoming a worthless paper weight or pointless bracelet for you.",

You don't have to do jumping jacks or aerobics...just walk and watch the calories burn. I like the 10,000 step notification (unit vibrates)...so you know when your out (just walking) that you just reached your daily goal without having to look on your smart phone. Sleek design. Like that is monitors my sleep..how many times awake or restless. I did notice that I got up the other night to let the dogs out and it decided I had finished sleeping and logged me as awake the rest of the night. SO now I hold my arm to my side so it just think I am heading out for a long walk. I don't mind not knowing what my heart rate is....so if you need that, buy the more expensive model. Can't wait to see if it works when I am riding my horse...hehehe",

There is even an \"expert\" on YouTube to show you how to do it with toothbrushes, q tips and chemicals. Sorry, but a professional product should not have to be so difficult to maintain. The IPhone is a far more complex product and needs no such silly maintenance gymnastics. Finally, even after getting replacements, they still do not work reliably.

            "review_text": "If you belong to Weight Watchers, the Fitbit is great. It transfers your step activities and translates those activities into weight watcher points. You would be amazed how many points your can accumulate on a daily basis just by walking. Walk around your house, pace while you are on the phone, use the bathroom furthest away from you. Those steps add up and as steps add up, so do the points. You don't have to do hours on a treadmill or laps around the track for the steps to add up. I live in Florida and its too hot to walk outside during the day. You rack up steps by going up and down every aisle in a store whether you need to buy something there or not. The Fitbit has some quirks. If you lay your hands on a grocery cart and not move the arm with the Fitbit, the steps aren't recorded. I have to pull the cart so the arm with the Fitbit can swing freely. One of the best features of the Fitbit is the challenge. There are several. I was asked to join the workplace hustle challenge. You can see how your steps add up with your competition. I thought my competitive nature had subsided when I retired. I was wrong. I was at least 30 years older than the other participants and came in at least third but more often first or second. It was great fun and got me hooked on getting those steps. Fitbit also shows you your calorie intake, how many calories you can eat for the rest of the day. You log your food and there catalogue of food is huge. I haven't found a brand that wasn't included. The sleep function is good for you to see when you were awake, when you were restless and how long you slept. If you are like me and tend toward insomnia, it helps that after walking 12,000 to 15,000 steps a day you will sleep at night. I have increased my activity and now I don't have a sedentary life style. The Fitbit has helped and their challenge did indeed challenge me. It is paying off too, at my last weigh in I lost over 3 pounds.",

I bought my first one in June and sometime in September on a day that I wasn't doing anything special it fell of my wrist - I took that one as my fault and decided maybe I didn't clasp it correctly. I ordered a new one and had it for about 2 weeks before it also disappeared this weekend while I was raking leaves - that's exactly the type of activity I need this thing to monitor. That's $200 down the drain. I've also had a fuelband and while I didn't like the way it tracked as much there was NO WAY that thing was coming off unless I took it off. DO NOT order this product unless they fix the bands or you duct tape it on. Pros - The technology is great. Loved tracking my food and calories with my activity. I especially loved the vibrating alarm because it allowed me to set an alarm without waking up my husband. I also liked adding my friends with bands and the competition. Cons - The bands stink. They are hard to get on at first but then just not secure enough so I lost TWO of them. Also related to the band - you take the bit in and out so I wore one of them out in less than 2 months and had to get a new one (customer service was great about it - but 2 months? That's crazy) Given the advanced technology and cost of this I feel like it's like putting a diamond in a aluminum setting - it's cheap and your going to lose your gem.",

I also noticed there are some that look less sporty too. The battery charges really fast, and last about 4 or 5 days. I usually charge it while I am watching TV.

As of today, I still can sync regularly. They're only solution is to set it to sync all day. That was my setting all along. They also said that even if the app says it's not syncing that the device is syncing anyway. That was completely untrue. My weekly progress report showed that I hardly walked even though I was doing 3 to 4 miles a day. Overall, when the device worked, it did a good job of tracking my steps.

            "review_text": "The idea of wearable technology that could track my fitness seems brilliant - who wouldn't want a device automatically helping you figure out your health by tracking your activity levels plus your sleep patterns that syncs with both your computer and your smartphone? Activity Tracking I work out six days a week. For four days, I use an elliptical trainer and weight training. On two days, I do Pilates and use a treadmill. I thought since the Fitbit tracks the number of steps I take, that it would work on the elliptical trainer - not so much. The machine tells me I ran 3.5 miles while my Fitbit says I walked 2.4 miles. Although the treadmill was far more accurate since I was running, I also want credit for the other workouts I'm doing such as the Pilates and weight training. There's nowhere to enter those activities into the app, so you just have to do it for staying healthy (which you should, but it defeats the point of the Fitbit, am I right?) Sleep Tracking Before you go to sleep, you set the Fitbit into sleep mode by tapping it for 2-3 seconds. This mode switching works easily enough and the Fitbit gives you a summary of your night's sleep patterns separated into three categories - sleeping, restless and awake. Sounds good, right? So, what's the problem here? I have a floofy cat (appropriately named \"Floo\") who enjoys singing the song of his people on a daily basis around 4:45 a.m. He wanders into my bedroom and meows his floofy little head off until I wake up, get out of bed and punt his floofy butt out of the room. Every night I wore the Fitbit, Floo came into the room and performed his show causing me to get out of bed and remove him from the premises. The Fitbit tracked NONE of these occurrences. In fact, the Fitbit showed that I wasn't even restless (much less awake), acting as if I slept through the entire night. Calorie Tracking The Fitbit apps includes a Calorie Tracking Diary with an extensive database of different foods and calories. This is a nice feature, however since you need to add your calories manually, I expect many Fitbit owners wouldn't use this feature. In addition, there are many Smartphone apps like MyFitnessPal's Calorie Counter app for iPhone, Android, Blackberry and more, which have much more extensive food databases and can be downloaded for free or very cheap. Not Motorcyclist Compatible I know what you're thinking: \"'Not motorcyclist compatible?' Um... what?\" Yes. I ride a cruiser and whenever I rode the cruiser, the vibrations going through my wrist would make the Fitbit change into Sleep Mode which would mess up my sleep tracking. (In case you're curious, no, motorcyclists cannot sleep while riding). Overall The Fitbit is a very neat idea for wearable technology that's not quite ready for prime-time. If Fitbit can develop a tracker that more accurately tracks all kinds of activity including physical and sleep, maybe I'll give it a try. For right now, unless you're an early adopter who tolerates a lot of deficiencies in a device just to have the newest technology, I recommend waiting until Fitbit fully bakes their concepts.",

Although the Fitbit Flex is not terribly accurate with it's step counter, as the website explains, that is not the purpose. It is more so supposed to \"motivate\" you to walk, and for that purpose, this is a great product. It's long lasting battery and portable charging cable make it easy to use when traveling, or just staying at home. If you are more \"nimble\" when it comes to technology, then the application that comes with this product is easy to use. Otherwise, you may need to get a kid to help you. (: In addition, the water resistant feature of the Fitbit Flex was a big purchasing point for me, and has been a feature I truly appreciate. Despite the great product, I had to remove a star because of the band it comes with. The band comes in a variety of colors, and will fit no matter what, as it comes with two sized bands. When you first attempt to clip the band on, it is close to impossible, and it was like this for a few days. Hang in there, though, as it gets easier. Unfortunately, it gets too easy, and after many weeks of happily wearing this product, it began to unclip and fall off when it got hit, and soon, began to fall off even while I was asleep. Luckily, you can buy cheap replacement bands on Amazon, but, considering most of the price of the product is the band, it is honestly a disappointment that it is falling off. You can also go onto the Fitbit website and purchase bands. Otherwise, the Fitbit Flex is a fun, easy to use product great for fitness, or for everyday use. I recommend it to anyone looking for a higher end step counter.",

I received the package shortly after within the week and was truly ecstatic to have gotten it. I have been using it ever since and have loved it, the application itself is very straightforward and simple to understand, especially the food option which calculates the calories and tells you how many you should be eating in a day in response to your weight and height. Overall this is an amazing product and I am supper happy to have this in my life. Like I said I was a little hesitant at first but after performing my research and getting all of my questions answered I went ahead and made the purchase, which might have been the best thing because it keeps me motivated as it is always there on my wrist but more so because in local stores this originally retails for $114.99, which is a steal for a deal.

My other issue is it counts absolutely everything as a step! I have an air purifier on my nightstand as I have very bad allergies, and if I set my Flex on the nightstand it counts the vibrations as steps. My husband has had the same issue with his Flex as he doesn't wear it at night and he uses a small fan on his nightstand.

I really got this as a sort of smart pedometer to work with the FitBit cloud platform. Their mobile apps is alright, their web app is actually pretty decent. Ideally, I'd want a device in this form factor to measure my heart rate and log it continuously. But this one measures paces. OK, best we can do for today, I'll try it. Riding to work on my motorcycle, I got credit for taking 10,000+ steps. It gave me haptic feedback a few times, blinked lights every now and then, all in all a particularly senseless/useless pattern of feedback. Sometimes it would go into sleep mode inexplicably. Oh, yeah, sleep mode... I should touch on that. How does it log your sleep? You have to tap it hard, repeatedly, and rapidly until it gives you the haptic feedback and blinking light routine to indicate that it's now tracking your sleep. Even though you aren't yet asleep. And when you wake up, you have to remember to go through that routine all over again. It's not smart enough to know when you're sleeping or when you're awake. Maybe Santa holds a patent or something.

It's been put off to the side, in the hopes that maybe someday there will be a much more clever firmware released for this hardware. Until then, I don't see it being useful to me if the data it provides is wildly inaccurate.",

The design is nothing more than a plastic band with a thin notification band. The plus side is that there are a ton of colors choices. If you want to fit your wardrobe, you can easily change band color. It is very light and comfortable. I had no trouble going to sleep with this band. Hardware - Responsive Fitbit has invested very heavily into the fitness hardware to power its line of tracking products. The device responds very accuracy to motion and taps. Additionally, I've found that it can differentiate between a finger tap and a accidental knock-against-wall. Software - Informative and Smooth - No Aggregate View Pro: The Fitbit software just works! Important daily stats like distance, calories, active minutes are clearly presented in the homepage so you don't need to go digging around. And device sync happens seamlessly. Con: No summary view/correlation view. I guess you can do this manually by looking at the stats each day. But why not do it in software! Bonus - Silent Alarm Clock is awesome - I would pay money just for this feature so my girlfriend and I don't keep waking each other up in the mornings. Pain - Untrained active tracking - I noticed that the devices mistakenly interprets sitting on SF MUNI as 'active time' Weak sleep tracking - Simply inaccurate and full of question marks. The restful sleep time only vaguely resembles the amount of time I spend on the bed. (See image below). Bias towards cardio - I go to the gym around 4 times a week, and only do cardio for 1 day. The tracking software does not really give me enough credit for the lift days Check out my comparison full review vs misfit shine here: [...]",

It has many cool features missing in the Nike like the sleep mode, and ability count calories (if you want), and what I think is a better way of measuring how many calories you are burning, etc. So, overall, it is a great product in the field. However, the clasping mechanism is a joke. It is like the cheap toy watches you give kids. It has two small prongs that are supposed to go into the holes and stay. The trouble is it is hard to get this done (specially with one hand). If you don't make sure it is all the way in (hard to know as you can't see it and you have to make sure to hear a soft click sound), it can come off easily. Well, this happened to my wife, on the second day she wore it and it is lost. I contacted the company and then sent me a link to a video on how you are suppose to put the thing on so I am sure they are aware of the problem here.

Only after accusing them of stall tactics did they honor their warranty. In May, same thing. In August, same thing. It took a month this time to even get an email response, which was a bogus (clearly a bot) response telling me to try what I already documented I did, and if that didn't work, then they would replace it. I replied same day (8 Sept 2014) that I had done so, no luck, please replace, and no response a month later.

I spoke to one of my patient and was told fitbit would be the one to go with. So I gave it a try! Here is how this product in my opinion: Pros: - slick design, light, comfortable - easy to set up with fitbit iOS app - Come with small and large bracelets (kind of helpful) - Love the vibrate alarm (my wife does not have to deal with my morning alarm noise) Cons: - INACCURATE DATA COLLECTION (the reason I want to use this item for tracking) 1. STEPS: you have the option to get to dominant or non-dominant hand, I had it set on dominant hand. According to my patient, she said it was really accurate and she tested it. IT WAS NOT!! I guess this device use some kind of accelerometer to measure your ARM SWING vs. actual steps. I took a quick walk around the living room and the steps counted were +/- 2, then I was sitting on the chair, swinging my arm, it still counting my steps. Within 15 minutes playing with my son, I've reached my sample goal of 5000 steps per day - this was accomplished without moving my legs. 2. DISTANCE - of course, it uses STEPS to calculate the distance I moved, this number is definitely incorrect. According to its data, I was moving 1.12 miles while play with my son 3. CALORIES BURNED: how does this calculate? I burned 1052 calories in 30 mins playing with my son! Wow...I guess I can start packing all my burgers wherever I go to keep my body working since I can burn calories that quick. 4. WEIGHT LOSS: I was playing with my son for 30 minutes. The stats show: 5 minutes active, 5000+ steps, 1052 calories burned, BUT I LOST 0.1lbs - I can't figure out the proper formula/equation to fit all these numbers together. 5. SLEEP TIME: From 11:40pm to 3:41pm, I was awake 96minutes, restless 192minutes, and slept for the rest. Which I can tell you, I was not sleep over 5 hours during this period. Can I count on this little thing to tracking my work-out? hmm...NOOOOOOOOO That's my spill...I might have different experiences with this device vs. other users. I think I might stay with Nike+ watch with Tomtom plus Heart Rate monitor sensor for HR tracking which can be use to calculate calories burned. Good luck with this device if you decide to get one.

I can't really recommend it until Fitbit does something about this thing slipping into \"sleep mode\" (a mode to track your sleeping habits which I also find useful). You would normally put it into sleep mode by tapping on it four of five times after getting into bed. I work in retail and there is something about pushing shopping carts from the lot to the store that puts this thing in sleep mode nearly every time. No problem if you notice it right away (it vibrates when it changes modes but my hands are vibrating quite a bit when pushing carts and I often don't notice the change in modes) but if you don't you'll lose hours of tracking time while the fitbit thinks you're having one heckuva restless sleep. It's frustrating and at times I want to take it off and give up on the whole idea. If there is a next time it won't be a fitbit.",

I wasn't happy with the clip provided as it was as loose as a West Fargo girl at prom. The clip that came with my wife's device was fine, but my Fitbit One fell out of the clip to often. I had it clipped to my belt and before the end of the 2nd week it was lost. I contacted Fitbit support and lodged my complaint and within 2 weeks I had a replacement. FANTASTIC customer support. I kept this replacement Fitbit One in my pocket to be safe, but never had a problem with the device falling out of the properly fitted clip. The next Fitbit device I purchased was the Aria. The device is great and fairly easy to use. I was able to setup the device quickly and it was well worth the $$ spent. It is easy to use and if for some reason a reading is bad or accidentally applied to another user of the device, it is easy to reassign or delete the reading. I really liked the idea of the Fitbit Force, so before Christmas of 2013, I decided to upgrade my One. While browsing, I found an incredible deal and ordered a new Fitbit before I realized I had ordered the Flex and not the Force. Of course I was initially disappointed that I had ordered the wrong product, but in the end it worked out as the Force was recalled not to long after. I really like the Flex as it picks up a lot of activities that I do where only a small portion of acceleration is done by my waist such as rowing, lifting and other activities where the focus is with the arms. I miss the elevation stats I had with the One, but I still prefer to wear the Flex as opposed to carry the One. This spring I picked up a new Fitbit Zip. I have not used it as much, because I have the Flex, but it is a great simple device that you don't have to worry about recharging as often as it uses a battery that you can replace every few months. In summary, all of the products are great and the support is just as great.",

If I keep it, I'd like to get a glow in the dark band, because sometimes I can't find stuff. Well, two weeks later, after setup, some use, evaluating performance: This is basically a piece of jewelry. If you want accurate information about steps, distance and/or calories.... stop right there. The thing will register a 'step' every time you use your arm.

Since getting the FitBit, I've definately increased my level of physical activity. Having the \"friends\" feature also helps you stay motivated since you can track your progress against your friend group - don't want to be the last one every week :) The setup is pretty simple and it's nice to be able to do a quick track on the band itself while also being able to get more detailed stats via the app or the website. Overall a good product to keep yourself accountable in terms of working out / physical activity. The only con I can think of right now is that it is not ideal for tracking all types of activity. One of my big workouts for the week is spinning which is not captured on the band since your hands are not moving. If the majority of your physical activity does not involve walking or running (e.g. bycycling, weights, etc) then perhaps this isn't the best monitoring tool. Caveat: I don't have experiences with other competitors e.g. Jawbone, etc so I can't comment on how it compares.",

When I first got it, the holes were so hard that I couldn't get the Fitbit on myself and had to have my boyfriend press it on and even he struggled. After I few times, I was able to get it on myself, but I only took it off to charge because it was a hassle. I always made sure that it the band was secured all the way, but even still, it fell off yesterday. I hadn't removed it since last Saturday, and hadn't done anything strenuous with my hands, so it should've been fine. I recommend that Fitbit replace the band with a watch-style one, so that it this doesn't happen to anyone else. I will be replacing my Fitbit with a Charge HR. Original review: I've had my Fitbit for only a week now, but it works great and is a simple, unobtrusive way of reminding me to walk more and be more mindful of my eating and sleeping habits. Since I am a competitive person, if I'm close to my goal or to a round number, seeing it pushes me to meet the target. The silent alarm works great too. I haven't found it uncomfortable to sleep in at all and it holds up well in the shower and pool. All in all, very happy!",

The reason for the three star only rating is that right now I am irritated. The only problem with this is the darn clasp on the wristband. I also don't like that it takes as long as three hours to fully charge. A charge lasts about 5 days. But after I charge and try to put on the band again..it is very very IRRITATING. All you have to do is just press the little clasps into the holes. No difficult things that require a lot of vision, coordination, or anything troublesome. BUT IT DOES NOT WORK WELL and it has not from the first day. Sometimes I can press it and it will connect. Other times the only way is to put the clasps on the lowest hole and then slowly yank it over my knuckles even though when it finally settles on my wrist it is quite loose. If they could just quicken the battery charging time and do something to make the clasp more user friendly then I would change to a 5 star rating. But yes...it is well worth the investment!",

Popping the electronic out is fast and easy. Easy to sync, but the accuracy of the data depends on other things as referred to in the next part. If I am driving and tapping the steering wheel (which I have a tendency to do with some rocking tunes), I do not need to find out that I just ran 3 miles because it is counting each movement of my arm. It is picking up every movement and just counting it. No regard for the fact that I am doing 80 down the highway which is impossible for a man/woman running or walking whatever. There really needs to be a smarter count and maybe the other ones have it.

The product warranty is 365 days but you should know that on day 366 they are going to tell you it's out of warranty. Period. On the good side, they will offer phone support indefinitely but this is a simple go/no-go product. But any product that just fails after such a short time is not a product I want to buy. Will try a Garmin and see if the exercise trackers are as reliable as their GPS units which I've had such good luck with.",

I am almost thankful I lost Flex horseback riding last week. Needing to interface with your computer or smartphone to know where you are in reference to your goals is a pain. I'm a teacher, so I wear a watch, which gets bulky when doubled up with the Flex. The Charge HR gives you all of your dashboard data and the time without needing to reference a smartphone. Flex requires you to tap on it to get into the sleep setting. Charge does that independently. Everyone I know with a Flex has had at least 1 wristband break at the place where the band it thinnest. The clasp is easy to open and close, which is great for taking it off and tossing it in my purse to wear on my shoulder pushing a shopping cart (otherwise Flex doesn't register the steps). That same feature makes it easy to lose. My friend lost his golfing. I'm a huge fan of their social media. I feel like my friends are walking with me even when they are in other states. To its credit, my Flex was instrumental in helping me lose 10 lbs over the summer (from 149 to 139 at 5'5\"). I did like being able to change the color of the wristbands.",

(just 2 examples) The band easily pulls off and I am constantly backtracking trying to find it. Over the 4th of July weekend I was wake surfing. This is a sport that requires of whooping 10 mph of speed to perform. During one of my falls the band pulled apart and is gone! Very frustrating. Why build an activity monitor that can only withstand light activities without falling off? Suggestion: Offer a band with a buckle clasp ever if you need to charge extra for it. Your band clasps are Micky Mouse to say the least and I have worried about losing it from the day I received it! Issue 2). If you are doing any work like hammering, shoveling or anything else where shock pressure might radiate through both hands/wrists, the device will think you are trying to put it into sleep or awake mode - so the mode is continually (accidentally) changing with repeated jolts. Suggestion: Incorporate a mode that locks it into regular activity mode and prevents it from going into sleep mode. I have truly enjoyed my Fitbit, but refuse to keep buying new devices that I know are just going to fall off. Who knows, maybe that was the intent???? I will not buy another one until they fix the band clasping deal!!!",

I don't know any of my friends who have Fitbit Flexes that haven't had problems with them in under a year of owning them. I've had mine for about 8 months and it's having trouble syncing. I now have to restart my phone on a regular basis to get it to sync (why does that seem to work? I have no idea). For around $100, I expect the thing to last for at least three or four years. I spent $200 on a Garmin Forerunner 201, and it actually lasted longer than the computer I synced it with! The Fitbit website is great... even the free version. They've done a great job of marketing, so all of your friends probably already have a Fitbit device. If you want to compete with the largest group of people for fitness tracking, they've got the largest market share for the time being. And maybe THAT is what you are paying for: the great website and the fact that all your friends already have one. And you know what? That alone is worth it. I'm just a little grumpy that I'll have to buy a new one in a year's time, because I'm pretty certain the one I got eight months ago is going to stop working soon. I'm hoping it lasts long enough for me to read reviews of how the Surge has fared after a year of use. I would happily fork over the $250 for a surge if I knew it would last a long time; like, for example, my $200 Garmin that's well over five years old. In short: Their website is great; all your friends already have one. I just don't trust Fitbit to make a durable device. Yet. Prove me wrong Fitbit.",

Sometimes it's just a few hundred but, other times, it's a few thousand. At first, I blamed my phone, but then I got a new phone and now I realize the Fitbit itself is defective. I reached out to Fitbit customer service who took over a week to send me a completely nonsensical and totally unhelpful response. They did not address the issue whatsoever and failed to offer any resolution to the issue.

It persistently does not accurately detect when I do HIIT exercises. For example, while doing a P90X3 workout, it only calculates that I've burned 10-15 calories for the whole 30 mins workout. Based on my heart rate, it should have detected ~300 calories burned. 2. It also on daily basis tells me incorrect number calories I still have to consume. For example, I have set a 500 calorie deficit under my goals (+/- 50 cal as per Fitbit calculations). By 4 PM, I would burn about 1800 calories and consume 900-1000 calories. Instead of saying I have another ~400 calories remaining to consume, Fitbit would say I can consume another 1400 calories. I stopped believing any Fitbit recommendations due to these gross and constant miscalculations. I want to be frank, the only useful feature in my Fitbit is the step counter. This feature is not worth $99 I spent on this product. I expect a full refund considering these issues with the product.",

It tracks my sleep, my activity levels, my steps, my calories (I input what I eat and it tells me what I'm burning throughout the day), etc. It's fantastic! You can set your goals to whatever you want, input all the information about yourself (height, weight, age, etc.), and let the Fitbit do it's thing. It works so well. The step count is not 100% accurate, but it's usually only off by a few steps each day. Out of 10,000 steps a day, I think 10 steps off is pretty darn accurate. I am trying to convince all of my friends to buy one of these now so we can challenge each other. It's really not hard to burn more calories a day than you eat...you just need to track everything food and drink item you put in your mouth so that you can really be aware of what your body is getting each day. There are some things I don't even bother drinking or eating anymore (like Starbuck's Frappuccinos...as delicious as they are) because I don't want to waste that many calories on something that gives me no fulfillment. From time to time, I treat myself, but most days I make sure I burn more calories than I take in. If you're looking to lose weight, this is a PERFECT product for you. If you've struggled in the past, like I have, you NEED the Fitbit Flex. Even if you are only burning 100 calories a day more than you eat, you are still going to lose weight. You should aim to burn 1,000 more than you eat a day, but if you struggle with setting your goals so high that you intimidate yourself and cannot achieve your goals, then this is definitely what you need to get. It's the small victories each day that keep me motivated, and the Fitbit's accuracy and variety of information it provides to you about your daily activity is unmatched by anything I've ever tried.

However, the last 20 pounds of a massive and permanent weight loss was getting to me, and $100 seemed like a reasonable investment. This little electronic gadget simplified my life and gave me information I didn't know I was missing. It tracks my steps, I track my food in the same place, the dashboard tells me if I am off track. I track my sleep, and specific workouts. All tracked and in one place with little effort. The biggest revelation was the bar graph of daily activity in 15 minute sections. I can tell when I sit too long, and my behavior has changed. It turns out that an alarm for sitting 30 minutes (offered by other brands) wasn't necessary. I just needed to see my patterns. I'm making progress on my weight because I'm confronted with the truth. Highly recommended. Not having a smartphone doesn't matter.

She took a cross training class on 6/5 for an hour, it did not detect it at all: did not add active minutes or calorie counts. We thought it might be a one time glitch and decided to give it another shot. She took another fitness barre class - came back panting and sweating. But according to FitBit, nothing happened - no steps, no active minutes, and no calories. That renders this product almost useless for most of the fitness activities that she does. Another incident happened earlier. The active minutes tracking was not working on 6/1 after she ran a half marathon relay. She opened a case. After several days, it seems to start updating the active minutes - though no explanation was provided under the case at all after 2 weeks of \"Our engineering team is investigating the root cause of this issue, and we are working on this matter to get solved as soon as we can.\" Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed with this product.

You would not think four little lights would tell you much but trust me you get use to it and realize that the fast slow blinking means. You can also set an alarm on it so it will buzz in the morning. I put mine on my night stand (don't care for the sleep tracker) and the vibration across the table does the job waking you.

This fitbit is nice because it isn't big and noticeable, and there are hundreds of different bands out there you can buy for it if you want it to look fun and match your outfits. Some cool features: 1-Uses bluetooth to link to your phone, computer, etc. 2-You can tap it to see where your progress is at for the day. 3-It tracks your sleep including how much you woke up, times you were restless, and if you are sleeping enough. 4-It is very accurate for tracking steps. I take the stairs at work and have counted my steps and it actually matched the fitbit count. 5-The app lets you add your fitbit friends and have competitions with them. There are a lot more features, but you get the idea. It's a great tool to use for fitness and weight loss!",

Of course it wasn't my Fitbit alone that made this happen but it was a catalyst to start watching my daily activity levels, getting in all that water and logging my food. I have several Fitbit friends and we regularly compete in step challenges. It gives you an added reason to get up and walk. I started with the Flex and quickly upgraded to the Charge HR to more accurately gauge my calorie burn during exercise and I couldn't be happier. I diligently checked my Fitbit several times a day and pushed myself to meet my goals and now I feel like a new person.

My fit bit no longer synchs. I have read forums, reset the device etc. My phone can not find the fit bit any more. What was once a seamless process is now an exercise in futility. My phone will try and try, but it almost never finds the device. Yesterday I tried for a good 20 minutes, over and over again to try to get it to synch without success. The device is not holding its charge. Yesterday afternoon (Saturday) my fitbit was dead. It had lights in the morning as I had left it on the charger all night, but by the end of the day it was dead. I compared notes with a co worker and he gets a good week long charge from his, there is no way that mine will stay that long. Resetting does nothing. Lights flash, but its not holding a charge and will only light up if on the charger or right off the charger. I really wanted to participate with all my co workers, but, I will not be putting more money into this product given that it seems by all the reviews that have the same issue, that getting a fitbit that isnt going to die after a short period of time.

I contacted fitbit and after sending them proof of purchase, they sent me a brand new one for free! I didn't even have to pay shipping. About the Flex: (four stars for the flex) My only real complaint is that the charger is really annoying to connect (although the newer one I have works pretty consistently whereas my older one never did). Other than that, the band can catch on things (and fall off) and it doesn't have a watch (If these things bother you, then probably the Fitbit charge is a better option).",

I have had no problem with this monitor coming off or with the clasp as some have mentioned. I wore my flex 24/7. I wore it while exercising, in the shower, while sleeping. I found the tracking to be fairly accurate. I found the online dashboard and the fitbit app and integration with other fitness apps, to be very helpful. The problems started about 3 months into using the flex. I normally used the flex's vibrating alarm to wake up in the morning, which is great for not disturbing one's partner. However, my alarm started to fail. It would not go off and I would log onto my dashboard to find it was not even set to on! This was strange but after it happened several times (resulting in my oversleeping for work), I concluded that this was not a user error but some kind of glitch with fitbit's dashboard. I would set the alarm to on, and eventually it would simply turn itself off. So, back to the good old alarm clock. Next problem came at 4 months. The charge held for less and less time. Initially I would charge the flex on sunday of each week. I would get a email reminder when the battery was low and usually had a day or two before it went dead. Well, now the battery goes dead within 3 days of a full charge. In addition, there is no warning email. It might be working fine at lunch and by dinner totally dead. No lights, no nothing. So now I have to charge every 3 days and can't use the silent alarm. The flex is now more of a nuisance than a fitness aide. I will add that I bought a 3 pack of extra bands. The colors are neat but the bands tend to look worn fairly quickly...like after two months of wearing it all the time. So now I've spent $130 on a device which was fully functional for only 4 months. I don't bother to wear it at all now, since I cannot confidently get a week's work of consistent data (used to love the weekly report). Overall, it's a great device for as long as it works but it doesn't work for long. At this price point, it is not worth it. It definitely encouraged me during the beginning phases of getting in shape. I have found that those who have established fitness routines, diet, etc, really won't benefit much from using the device. Unless they're really into vibrating tethers. So, if you need a pedometer, get a basic one. If you want to monitor exercise and diet, use an app (any many of those are free) or even something as simple as paper and pen.",

I logged a formal complaint, and days went by with no response. Finally, I went onto the forum and complained that I was getting no response, and said I'd have to take it to the streets to register my dissatisfaction with the quality of the band and the lack of customer service, and I quickly got a message saying that they were backlogged with prior complaints. It is such a pity, because if the band hadn't broken so easily, I would have gladly given the Flex high marks. As it is, I can't do it. I just hope that Fitbit will do the right thing and replace the band, so I can at least come back here and say that they did that.",

I was awoken by my backup phone alarm after my Fitbit silent alarm did not work (it was synced up properly prior to bed time). After looking at my phone app, I realized that my sleep cycle was not actually mapped so I had to take the time to research how to map it out myself. When I did, It said that I slept the entire eight hours and never woke up when in reality I woke up a minimum of three times. Finally, I wore the fitbit flex for seven hours while walking continuously at my job as a technician at an emergency veterinary clinic and only one hour before my eight hour shift ended did it register that I had walked 10,000 steps. For reference, that is the suggested number of steps everyone takes daily. There is no way that anyone is walking seven plus hours a day. Long story short, this product is a disappointment and none of its features work correctly. Get a one dollar pedometer and the free MyFitnessPal app and you will save 79 dollars and your time.",

It will no longer take a charge. the battery run s down and I can't charge it up again. It is now useless. I bought two new battery charges, but that did not help. Please don't buy this. I am working with fitbit and Amazon on a replacement. I want to try the fitbit charge, as my daughter has one and loves it. ****** end of update Firstly, I want to make it clear that my favorite fitbit product is the zip. It doesn't depend on wrist movement and it has an easy to read display and tells time. It does not have to be recharged and the battery life is relatively long. So why am I wearing a flex? Well, I bought 5 zips for various members of my family. We sort of compete. Two of the zips were broken (user carelessness, not a product problem), and one was lost (mine). Also we often would forget to wear the thing. So I bought a flex that I never have to take off except to charge, and it is unlikely that I will drop it. That is the sole reasons that I bought it. It seems to be accurate when compared to my wife's zip. It would probably be useless for someone that uses a stationary bike, or cycles as it depends on wrist movement. I use an elliptical machine that promotes arm movements, but if it did not, I would not get my steps. It supposedly will track sleep, but I find that to be totally irrelevant. I take mine off at night. The only display it has are five small lights that will give you an approximate percentage of where you are in reaching your goal. To get a true count of my steps I must sync it with my smart phone, which is easy, but not as easy as looking at a display. The charge has lasted me for at least a week. I have not let it run down completely. The band that comes with it appears to be cheap plastic, at any rate it looks like cheap plastic, but it is light and I don't notice it on my wrist. I rate it four stars because it fits unobtrusively on my wrist and does what I want it to do.",

I like that I don't see the actual step count (since I get a little neurotic when I pay too close attention to it)...just the little lights that approximate how close I am to my goal. However, I had gotten in the habit of using the Zip for a timepiece, and I keep looking at this one (which is where a watch would be if I was wearing one) and then remembering it doesn't tell time. The sleep tracker function is interesting, but I don't really know that it's earth-shattering or even particularly useful information to know that I sleep better some nights than others. But the big difference is that this one is so much more sensitive (i.e. inaccurate) compared to the Zip. I'd say it overestimated my steps by as much as 15% or even 20%. I usually struggled to get to 10,000 steps a day with the Zip, but I was registering all kinds of steps with the Flex. (My husband attributes this partly to the fact that I talk with my hands, which I'm sure is part of the problem.) I followed the trouble-shooting advice and set the tracker for \"dominant hand\" but wear it on my non-dominant hand. This is supposed to be one way to adjust the tracker to make it less sensitive to movements that aren't actually steps. I think it still may be a little off, but not nearly as much as when I was first using it. Compared to the Zip, the Flex just seems to sense movement in general instead of only steps. When we ski, my Flex registers steps while my husband's Zip doesn't...although we don't have exactly the same form, so that may add to the discrepancy. Overall, now that I've adjusted it, I'm pretty pleased with the Flex.",

I've since then purchased some extra bands for myself. I have no had any technical issues with my fitbit, I find it easy to use, motivating and it is attractive enough that I do not feel strange about wearing it to work.

It's a shame, because I really did like using the flex. I should also note that both size bracelets that came with my flex broke around the 1 year mark, so I needed new rubber bracelets to use it. Because of the battery issues, I opted not to buy anymore bracelets. I have other options to wear the flex, but have pretty much lost interest because of the battery problems.",

The only drawback really is that you have to remember to log your food and sometimes you aren't able to find the food that you are eating or maybe you aren't sure on the portion size so you might have to guess how many calories or if you are at work and don't have time to get on your phone to log the food you can go back and log it later but sometimes I forget. Another thing I didn't like is that the wrist bands aren't very durable, but they do sell replacement ones online. For me the band only lasted a month, but then again I am a mechanic so that is fairly understandable. If you are serious about getting into shape get one of these. Some of the really cool features are the sleep monitor,You can also set alarms. It isn't bulky so you don't have to worry about unwanted attention from other people who ask a million questions(you know the type if you're an introvert like me but you could just get the one that tells time and say its a watch.) I like how the app is an easy way to track your weight and other stats and it recommends how many calories to take in if you want to meet your goals. It is easy to log your water, the app has user friendly charts, and there are lots of support groups online. Another neat feature is that you can tell it to map your walk. there's a lot more you can tell it to do but that's what I do with it. Something that needs to be fixed is on the windows 8 app I wish there were a way to move around the icons. Like they have a huge emphasis on competing with your friends and it'll say like hey you are number one among your friends! and I'm like Hey that's great too bad I don't have any ftibit friends! or same deal when it tells you that you can lose more weight by competing with people. I'm considering friending people that I dont know but im skeptical......I also wish my fitbit flex monitered my heart rate but that doesnt really matter.",

I haven't had any trouble getting it to sync between my mobile, my laptop, and my tablet at all (all Android). I have found that it really is helping me to stay motivated to get my exercise in, and I love all of the options to log my food and additional activity, etc. It is comfortable to wear - similar to wearing a watch, and I hardly notice it. They say you can wear it in the shower, but I haven't yet - no real reason other than I take my watch off, so the Fitbit comes off too. When I use the treadmill, I attach it to the top of my shoe or wear it around my ankle if my socks don't get in the way. When you hold onto the handles of the treadmill, the step count may not be accurate without the combination of arm and leg movement. The sleep monitor function is fairly accurate because I also have a Sleep Number bed that has the Sleep IQ feature and it monitors my sleep/wake patterns, (as well as heart and breathing rates), and the figures between the Fitbit and Sleep IQ match up pretty well. Actually the first night, in the morning when I attempted to change it to \"awake\" I wasn't wearing my glasses but thought I got it. When I logged onto the dashboard later on the computer, I found out I was still \"asleep\" so it registered me as having slept very restlessly between 6am and 9am! It's really easy to log food and I was surprised at the huge database of foods and brands. Once you log a food it remembers it so you can easily choose it again. You can also create new foods and edit foods for even more accuracy. I will make edits to my review as time goes on and I have had the opportunity to spend more time with it.",

To log everything the software has to offer, it would probably take me 10-15 minutes daily, which i don't have among my priorities. I have encountered skin irritations from constant wearing, and I did have to get a replacement medium band from customer service about 4 months into my purchase due to it breaking at the seam and becoming unable to use. Fitbit customer support replaced the band without charge with accompanying pictures to show the damage, which was nice. The skin irritation is annoying, especially when utilizing their tips to wipe down the band etc. It's a trade-off I am willing to accept, but using an anti-microbial band material would be an excellent upgrade for future product development.",

The Fitbit Flex is very convenient. It seamlessly updates wirelessly to my Android phone (Galaxy S4) as soon as I open the app on the phone. The company provides both a web application and both iPhone and Android phone applications. I'm getting about 5.5 days per charge. It only takes less than 1-hour to fully recharge when I connect it to the USB port on my computer. I was interested in this device to get some insight into my sleep habits. Through using this device, I found out that I'm only getting about 5.5 hours sleep out of 7.5 hours in bed, which explains why I'm often sleepy mid-day. Keep in mind that this device is an \"activity\" counter, not a step counter. Since it is typically worn on the wrist, it measures arm and gross body movement, but that does not necessarily translate into \"steps\". If you realize that then you shouldn't be as concerned about some of the other reviews saying that the Flex is not accurately counting steps.

Some reviewers said they fixed this by putting the device around their ankle, but I was definitely not about to do that. -I never felt like I got an accurate readout of caloric burn, but that probably is also related to the pedometer issue. -Plastic band agitated my skin after a few days. -Would have been nice to have some other readouts, such as heart rate throughout the day or something similar.

Very close, so it appears to be pretty accurate in the step count. You will count steps with arm movement that is beyond the normal amount. For example, if you shake your arm, it will register as steps. (The same will happen on a traditional pedometer if you shake it). Bottom line, it's about as accurate as I would expect a pedometer to be. I find the strap difficult to put \"snap\" . That could be a good thing so it stays in place, but I also find it frustrating at times. Battery Charging: this is a bit finicky. (lots of posts on the Q/A portion of the web page). It does not always seat well in the charger. The use of a rubber band or other mechanical device will work, but the design of the charger should be a bit better. I question the accuracy of the sleep tracker. Since this device is movement centric, it's hard to know who well it is working. I will say, on those days when I feel like I had a restless evening, there tend to be more restless times that were reported. Overall, if you are looking for a decent pedometer that syncs with your iPhone, it's pretty decent. If nothing else, it does keep your focus on more steps, which tends to increase your steps. For that reason alone, likely worth the money",

The wristband, on the other hand, is poorly designed. It has fallen off multiple times and, because of its design, you don't really notice that it happened. Fortunately someone else noticed that it happened in each case and brought my wayward device back to me. That said, I keep the device in my pocket most of the time now which probably affects its accuracy. The primary problem with the wristband design, IMO, is that it doesn't have a positive locking mechanism. Essentially it is \"fastened\" with a pressure fitting (you push two tabs through rubberized holes). As a result, it doesn't take much pressure to pop these tabs out of their holes. I see where some people have \"Magyvered\" solutions for this with a silicon plumbing washer...but frankly, I'm disappointed that such a solution is necessary. In summary...

The wristband (black on mine) is awful. The first one started tearing at the joint between the silicone and the translucent window, within just over a month of daily wear (which was only 5 cycles of taking the tracker out and replacing it after charging!!!). Warranty replacement went well, but I did have to send in pictures (yes, plural) of the defect and wait almost 2 weeks to get a replacement. The replacement tore in the same spot about 3 months later. I said to Hell with it and used my wife's unused grey band and it's been holding up well. MUCH better than the black. Then the tracker went crazy and vibrated, flashing 2 dots and nothing else for about 30 seconds. I do have a silent alarm set, but at 3:45 AM weekdays, not Noon-ish on a Saturday! Upon syncing with my iPhone, I got a red X in the battery and nothing else. Mind you, this was the same day I took it off the charger so it was 100% charged that morning. I scoured the support sites and tried everything, oftentimes twice. No avail. This time, customer service told me to try syncing it again. Then they told me to charge it. Then they told me to reset my phone (the problem was my phone?!?!?!?!). Nothing worked so I gave up on it for about 2 weeks. I then put it on the charger and it's been working ever since. In short, not at all reliable in the long term but I'm using it until it dies again. Would I buy another Fitbit? No way! Especially with the issues they are having with the Force bands.

I am now ready to step it up to the next model, but I need to stay in the Fitbit family. I love the Fitbit \"community,\" and have connected with friends to compete or encourage. Wonderful product! I've had no problem with accuracy. I can't endorse this product or company enough and I've not been incentivized to do so.",

The second time I was out and wearing a cardigan with very loose sleeves. I guess that when I removed that, it pulled the Fitbit off. I didn't realized it until after I got home. I called everywhere I had been, but no one had turned it in. I contacted Fitbit.com and chatted with \"Phoebe\" there. She, for all intents and purposes, indicated that it was my fault for not inserting the clips tightly enough. Believe me, after that first incident, I made very sure that it was tight when I put it on. It is not waterproof, so you have to take it off to shower.

I installed the app on my Android phone and have been using it with no problems. The app helps you to set a target goal (number of steps, weight to lose, diet, etc.) and then encourages you to meet those goals. The standard is 10000 steps a day, which is difficult to reach without making an effort to walk more (unless you live in an urban setting). Since I live in the suburbs and have to drive to work or to do errands, I've found that I need to make lifestyle changes to meet these goals. For example, I've started working at a standing desk when possible, and I've made more of an effort to incorporate more walks in my day. (Two half hour stroller walk with my daughter, plus a shopping errand, brought me about 80% of the way to my goal). So far, the only feature that does not always work is the sleep function. For the last few nights I tapped the device as instructed when I went to sleep and woke up, but my sleep was not logged. You can manually enter sleep time, though, and the app will indicate how much sleep you actually got (and how often you were restless) during the night. It turns out I get less sleep than I thought--something to work on!",

This devise is a great incentive to exercise and reach your goals so unless I'm out of town or at meetings, I exercise everyday. I like it better now that I have the Aria scales as a companion to it. You can see all the reports when you sync to the website. The calorie counter is not always handy especially when it's the next day and you can't remember exactly what you ate, but it you sit down in the evening and register everything it's great.

But when it consistently failed to track my activity, even power walking without carrying anything, I returned it. I routinely walk during my lunch hour ... roughly the same pace along the same route. In a given week, several days I would have a full hour of activity, other days I would have 3/4 of an hour and still others would show just a half hour. And based on that inaccuracy, I never did try and sync it with the Wellness website/portal, so I don't know how that works. A couple coworkers have Fitbits and swear by them. They say they have no problems with accuracy/tracking, so who knows what I'm not doing \"right\" to get it to track correctly. But as an example, a I friend and I went hiking together, both with our Fitbits on. Neither of us had much activity before we started hiking. By the time we reached the half-way point, she had over 10,000 steps. I didn't reach that point until I was 3/4 of the way through the hike. I didn't expect us to reach 10,000 steps at the same time, but this was a significant gap ... over two miles. All I know is I went back to the old-fashioned way of keeping track ... look at my watch when I start. Look at my watch when I finish. Or if I want to track the actual number of steps, I put on my pedometer, which for me is much more accurate.",

I know someone with the fitbit one and they have had issues with it, and I thought I would like one on my wrist better anyway. I do like the wrist wear better in some respects. But I feel like the best way to review this is to list what is good and what is not. Good: I love that you can compare your steps with friends who also have fitbits on their website. I love sleep tracking. (FYI, it really only tracks movement and not anything else.) I love that it syncs with my phone. I love that it is easy to put into sleep mode. I love that I can order different color wristbands, although I haven't yet. I also think this does a good job with accurately counting my steps- but there are times it doesn't. Supposedly you can shower with it, although I haven't tried it. Less Good: There is not an altimeter on this one. Since I live in a split level home, I am always walking up and down stairs. I always make my goal for flights of stairs, so this isn't a huge loss. You can't see how many steps exactly you have taken on the device. I would really hate this feature if my phone wasn't compatible. The step count is less accurate if you are pushing a shopping cart. I found this out on my first day. Since I had the Ultra for so long, I know what kind of step range to expect when I grocery shop. Considering I kept forgetting stuff and backtracking, I should have had double the steps the Flex recorded. Sometimes my sleep mode activates when I am doing things like baking or pushing a shopping cart. *Added January 20, 2014: After only three weeks, there is a hole in my wristband that resulted in putting the tracker in the wristband and taking it out. I think this is a huge design flaw- I mean- you HAVE to take it out to charge it. The plus side is, I contacted customer service at Fitbit and they are sending me a new wristband since my flex is still under warranty. I have always had good experiences with Fitbit's support- I had read that this isn't always the case, but I have contacted them several times over the past two years and they've always been responsive and quick. Overall, I love this product and would recommend it to anyone. The lack of visibility on the actual device for all the steps I take would be a deal breaker if I had the wrong phone. But lots and lots of phones are compatible- and more will be added, I am sure.",

The new package is slightly different, with different care instructions. For example, it now says to wear the band loose enough that the product can breathe. It also instructs you to clean and dry the unit, so I have a feeling it's not quite as waterproof as they originally thought. I also noticed the Fitbit site no longer has a picture of a guy wearing his on the beach. So this time around, I'm taking it off for showering and swimming. Hopefully, it will last longer.",

I plugged it in and a light came on but wouldn't stay lit. If I pushed it into the charger it would light up. I was about to wedge it in there with the toothpick when it stayed lit. It fully charged.

I made sure to place the flex on my non-dominate wrist as suggested. The first two days I used it I discovered how inaccurate it was. Both days I was sitting at my desk at work when I felt it vibrate to let me know I had reach my step goal for the day (even got the report on my phone telling me congratulations). After some research I changed my setting to say the flex was on my dominate wrist while still wearing it on my non-dominate one. The idea, per the FitBit Flex website is that the sensitivity setting would be reduced when told it was on my dominate wrist. Since then I've had it go off several times to tell me I had met my step count while I was sitting at my desk. I do figit a lot and rock in my desk chair. That I know is part of the issue as there is movement and so the flex records it. For what the device is I can't really complain. It's not so high tech I can tell it that these small movements are me at my desk. I wish I had more control over it so I could get some better results. Not sure I'd by this again.

Tracks our sleep, allows us to record our food, much more sophisticated than a step counter. Main issues: 1) The actual bands split fairly easily and not long after you start using it. Maybe that's why they push the sale of extra bands as well. 2) The battery of the fitbit can run out even when it's not in motion. As I stopped using it once my band snapped, it didn't take long for the power to simply drain. Sure, it wouldn't be an issue if I continually used it, but it probably wouldn't be significant at all if they just made more durable bands. 3) In tracking food intake, there are major improvements to be made, especially the ability to select ethnic food. I know that in a situation where certain food we eat is not among the choices, but it's a recurring issue. So, it doesn't even come close to giving us an accurate calculation of calories we take. There are people who don't feel that the typical \"all-American\" diet is very healthy while we purchase this Fitbit to help live a healthy lifestyle.",

            "review_text": "I have tried at least three other \"tracker\" devices over the past several years, and this is by far the easiest to use, most comfortable, and most comprehensive tracker I have found to date. (And best looking by far!) Past products I've tried have not synced correctly or had software issues, were not waterproof (one required a waterproof pouch @ $45, and then it never worked in the water anyway!), or they were just plain bulky, ugly, and uncomfortable. The Flex works great with my laptop, iPhone and iPad Mini (check for their list of pairing devices -- the app is free). I love the \"silent alarm\" feature and use it throughout the day when I need to remind myself of something, as well as at night as a silent alarm clock. It's waterproof, so you can wear it in the shower or to swim. (NOTE: swimming needs to be logged as an activity; the tracker does not track swimming.) The battery lasts several days before it needs to be recharged. In general, I love the look, the feel, and the ease of wearing and using the tracker. In the three weeks I've had it, I have begun to see a change in my awareness of when and how much I am moving, and when I need to work on moving more. At the end of the week, Fitbit sends me a weekly summary report by email. Except when it needs to be charged, I never take it off, and today I ordered a couple more wristbands in different colors so it will blend with whatever I'm wearing. Update: After I wrote the initial review, I became more familiar with the food-tracker, and I am more hooked than ever. The software contains the nutritional information for most common ingredients as well as for many popular brand items, or I can customize by inserting the nutritional information from food labels. Now I can track both my intake and output of calories to meet the target goals I have set for myself. Last night I found I was just 100 steps short of my daily goal, so I walked around the house several times while brushing my teeth just to get the \"smiley face\" and \"Hooray\" to close out my day. Apparently, I don't require much in the way of rewards to inspire me to move just a little bit more!! Best Christmas present I've ever given myself.",

It is VERY waterproof -I wore it to a water aerobics class and for 50 minutes I moved moved moved. The FitBit was under water most of that time and was fully waterproof. Sadly, it never logged any sort of activity for me for that whole 50 minutes!!! The activity choices are Walk, Hike, and Run. No biking. No calesthenics, yoga, or in place aerobics in general. Sometimes when I go to the gym and workout it doesn't log that as general activity. That being said, I know when it's time to go to the gym and the easy calorie tracker with the phone app helps me push the plate away. I really like it for convenience and step counting.

I have finally thrown up my hands and accepted defeat. I can no longer waste any more time. Fitbit WINS. What an amazingly FRUSTRATING experience in consumer alienation. I'm usually a pretty calm guy but these people are relentless, ugh. It seems that now that the Apple watch has made an appearance in the marketplace Fitbit is doing everything possible to screw things up with their customers. I guess this is called customer \"no-service\". My wife and daughter both have Fitbit Flex units. Overall the units are pretty good but there have been a couple of issues: 1) On our daughter's Fitbit Flex we have to \"wiggle\" it in the charger in order for it to start charging. 2) On the Fitbit Flex that my wife has, within 6 months, the Fitbit wristband cracked at the location where the \"pod\" inserts. I would really expect that an original Fitbit wristband would last longer than 6 months. This is worn every day and is removed for charging and showering, so it is well used, but I'd expect the band to last for years, not months. I hope Fitbit works out these issues.",

Also, when on the wrist as recommend, it doesn't work when pushing a grocery cart or stroller which means either I don't get the steps counted or have to remember to push with only one hand, band comes undone and falls off more than I would like (afraid I may lose it one day). Also, my husband is able to wear the large band, and I wear the small. He bought his fitbit in a different color, and viola, we each have two bands in different colors. Since I purchased the fitbit, I've noticed more types of activity trackers on the marker, some of which are more \"stylish\". If purchasing again, I think I would like to get someone that doesn't look so \"industrial.\" Also (probably goes without saying) - a fitbit is not going to make anyone more fit.

Just being aware of what you are eating and reading calorie numbers on products you are eating really get portions under control. I bought a new one because I like my results and it makes me really watch what I eat and how much.

I selected this model because it was the newest one stating that it was waterproof. However after using this for just 3 months I am having issues. The charging that when new lasted 6-7 days is now 18-40 hours. I very rarely use the alarm features and only check my progress a couple times a day which is what the website states will deplete the battery quicker. I submitted a warranty request online as they state to do and after 5 days have not received a reply. The fitbit website stated 2-3 day response.

I was never able to do this when I was actually trying to go to sleep but if I was messing around with it during the day, it would work with no problem.

We figured it's because I was pushing the stroller. I would just go in and add exercise though in the app to get our steps to the same place at the end of the day.

The pulse is great but the Flex has some advantages that looked interesting and worthwhile. Firstly, the ability to always have it on you as opposed to remembering to bring the Pulse with you. It also has a great alarm that wakes you with gentle vibrations. The software with the Fitbit Flex is better than the Pulse..It syncs easily and the whole experience is more in depth and well..just better. I've been wearing the Flex for two days and I took them out today and did a formal comparison, mostly concerned with accuracy to the amount of steps and distance traveled. The walk I did I know to be a bit over one mile yet the Flex recorded it as about half a mile.. That's a big difference, so much as to render the Flex useless in this capacity. The amount of steps was about 10% greater on the Flex as compared to the Pulse. But wearing the flex in the house, which was a big draw to having a tracker on all day turned out to be useless. I changed the dominant hand to right as Fitbit suggests wearing it on the non dominant wrist..I am right handed. The differences in recorded steps in my apartment compared to the Pulse was stark. The Pulse was right on accurate, The Flex was laughably inaccurately..It recorded about 300 steps in my small bathroom while shaving. To me this means that the only way to really use such an inaccurate tracker might be only for dedicated walks and excersize...that would require turning it off at other times. I'm surprised how inaccurate this product is and am going to return it. It's a shame as there is so much good about this product but anyone using it will be in for a rude awakening to see that the total real steps taken in a given day might be off by 100%. I'll read up to see what I could have been doing wrong but as said, it doesn't seem to be anywhere near accurate to wear in the home and the distance traveled was so way off.

The silent alarm is helpful, although not strong enough to wake me up in the morning (understandable-- I could probably sleep through a hurricane). Essentially the Fitbit flex is a pedometer that vibrates and has indicator lights. No more, no less. If you're expecting otherwise, then this tracker isn' for you. I've had no issues with getting it wet, although I recommend you get fasteners for the band: http://goo.gl/eOAGCG (this link goes to amazon btw). Once, when leaving school, I found that I felt my wrist was considerably lighter than it had been before. Unfortunately, I found that this was because my tracker was missing! Running back to class, I was lucky to find it was right where it had fallen off. The motion of putting on my backpack rubs considerably against the wristband, and, as a result, it had come undone. I *didn't* want $100 going down the drain, so I got these fasteners' (which work quite well). update (1/9/2016): so I had a bit of an odd issue with this thing last year, but it's totally fine now.. mostly because it was replaced. For some reason, the Flex was just refusing to hold a charge for longer than an hour. Due to the nature of this device, that's just unacceptable! Luckily, the Fitbit company is a pretty helpful one, and their customer service is fantastic! They paid for me to mail them back the defective one and they sent me a knew one ASAP.",

Battery life is decent, about 4-5 days, easy to charge.

Also you have to turn it on sleep mode when you go to bed, and turn it off when you get up in the morning. Not a big deal, but I end up forgetting to take it out of sleep mode, til I am at work, and by that time, the sleep reading is not accurate. Also, not sure how accurate the step counter is(especially when you are carrying something and your arm is not swinging).

            "review_text": "I decided I would lose 30 pounds from the start of last year until my son's wedding in October, 2014. Coincidentally, I was given a Fitbit Flex for Christmas, so I decided to walk, setting a goal of 85,000 steps a week. The feedback is tremendously helpful, as is the ability to have others whose progress you can observe and with whom you can compete if you wish. The first Flex did have some problems with charging. The cradle was not tight, and it often required using scotch tape to secure it properly. It stopped working in about three months. I called customer service and suggest anyone call rather than making an on-line request. The service was great, and I had a new Flex within three days. It has been totally reliable over the past nine months, and I continue to be motivated to walk. I am 72 years old, did lose the 30 pounds and walked just over 2,000 miles in 2014, or about 40 miles a week. Most will not want to walk that much or be able to devote that much time to walking. It has motivated me to now join a fitness club for more strength development, and energy levels are out the roof even though they were fine previously. I also have the Fitbit scale and like the way it tracks weight on-line. It is easy to fool yourself unless you keep a log, and it is helpful to know that you can splurge at times and not gain and to observe when your weight begins to creep up a pound or two. The Flex does not do your walking, but it is an amiable and supporting partner that can be useful for people of all ages.",

The website is helpful, tracking calories, steps. I like seeing my progress on the Dashboard during the day. Logging what I eat is as easy as other websites I've used. (Weightwatchers, Fitday). I like that it breaks it down into Carbs, protein, sodium, etc. Tracking my sleep patterns was revealing. What I am disappointed in: the steps / distance is not terribly accurate. I've measured this on a treadmill (not holding the handrail). So I've measured my stride and entered that into the settings, which helps in that regard, but it still misses steps. Sometimes it tells me I've walked a distance, but the number of steps it tells me I've walked are way off what that distance would require. I've pretty much given up on trying to get that perfect. The set up was not smooth, and I had to force a link. There are many similar complaints in the user forum, and luckily there were instructions on how to do this \"force\" if the setup failed. Getting it into sleep mode was difficult at first, but again the user forum was helpful. Now that I have the hang of it it's easy. In summary, it's great as a reminder to move more, and tracking is helpful in a general sense, like comparing day to day. As far as meeting a step goal, as long as you know it's kind of that many steps, and not really exactly that many steps, it's great. I see it as a great toy, and it is helping me to pay more attention to my activity level and calories. So for me it's serving it's purpose.",

I tried everything they said and still doesn't hold a charge. It says battery is medium but it is dead. I charge it and it works for a day and needs charged again. Then last week, fully charged but wouldn't register steps. Found online how to reset it, that did make it start counting steps. I get an email about every 2 weeks that says it is time for me to charge. What a joke. I charge 3 to 4 times a week. Very disappointed.

I still make my goal but I have to ride a bike and strap the tracker to my foot. I wish it had a watch feature and automatically detect sleep so the next Fitbit I buy will be a Charge. The Flex's clasp is a nightmare, It is ridiculously hard to snap on, painful really. I have to turn it around to snap it on and then rotate it back because the snap is on the underside of my arm which is soft and tender compared to the top.

Large band fits well, can go in the shower (but I'd take it off just to be safe), and is comfortable to wear 24/7. The sleep tracker is pretty interesting, but I don't really see it's purpose. I already know how much and how well I sleep, but the silent alarm is pretty cool since it won't wake anyone else up but you. Definitely everything I wanted it to be.

It has three metal contact point on the back, when you slide it into the charger there is some kind of connection issue. It lights up like is charging for a few seconds but when you go back to get it, its still dead. Many nights i left my FitBit to charge over night in the charger and had no juice in the morning. What's the point if its always dead! I have tried numerous methods to get it to stay on the charger but its not worth the hassle. I don't want to waste 10-15 minutes every 3-4 days trying to get it to recharge. My clients with Fitbit also have the same issues and most have given up on it as have i. FYI the band is also not very comfortable, i was constantly taking it off for some relief, some of my clients who left it on started to develop a rash. If your looking for a pedometer keep looking.

I was keeping track of my steps and sleep with my iPhone via the app MotionX. Since I do not always have my phone with me I thought the Fitbit would give me a better step count and as a plus it also tracked sleep. Strangely enough after I started using the Fitfit my daily activity seemed to fall and after taking walk/step tests, I find this Fitbit only counts about one out of three steps. The MotionX also does a much better job of tracking sleep/awake time. Might have been better with a $20 pedometer.",

Mine developed a major tear in a few weeks, and it's not like you can just pick up any old band. 2. It only lasts about 5 days between charges. This would be OK except that because there's no wireless charging, you have to remove the band, remove the device from the band (that's what caused the tear), and connect it to the proprietary USB charger. I can understand taking it off my wrist, but I should be able to set it down on a Qi charger or something and keep it in the band. 3. The band gets a bit \"yucky\" inside and out. I haven't had the \"bad smell\" problem at lot of users do, but it does get a bit wet and gross in there. 4. Because you have to tell it when your sleep starts and ends, I almost always forget, and sleep tracking was the main thing I wanted it for. So I end up having to go to the web site and record my sleep times, or just do without sleep tracking yet again. I don't know how they could fix this realistically - perhaps be more proactive about prompting me for sleep times or some very clever activity level detection or something - but it's really annoying nonetheless. 5. Because it's relying on wrist movements, if you want it to pick up treadmill steps, you need to let your arm hang and swing like some kind of idiot, or fake it. I fake it by taking it off my wrist, sliding it into my show laces, and letting it pick up the shoe's up/down movement. That seems to work quite well and the step count matches the treadmill's step count. 6.Because of the proprietary charging cable I'm constantly worried I'll lose having to be a wired affair, while it's charging (and it takes hours - it feels like forever), you are not getting any activity tracking. I try to time my charging around long desk periods as a result. 7. Although my computer has a BT 4.0 compatible adapter and sees the Flex fine (device name is \"Quartz\"), the Fitbit Windows software only will work with the proprietary baby BT adapter that they include, so now I have two things I have to worry about losing when I travel (the charger and the sync adapter). If I had an iPhone - which I don't - then in theory I could sync to that, but since I'm in the vast majority of people in the world who don't in fact own an iPhone, I'm stuck with this stupid little proprietary thing because of programmer laziness. (And no, you can't leave them at home and deal when you get back, because the battery lasts less than a week and the memory on the device only holds about a week, so any weeklong trips mean you either charge for hours just before you leave, or have the stuff with you.) So overall, this is a nice effort, and I'm glad I bought it, but it's very far away from ideal. 8.",

I ride a bike quite a bit and today after a 45 minute ride, I made sure it synced with my computer. It indicated I'd met my goal 100%, then \"blinked\" the sleep mode a couple of time and I realized it probably had jarred itself into and out of sleep mode more than a couple of times because the Dashboard indicated I'd only gained a total of 3,043 steps and had 3 active minutes.

It is fun to go back and see the progress. ** UPDATE ** Ordered my replacement band on 8/1. It is 10/10 and I still don't have a the replacement or any communication on when it will ship. What really irritates me about this company is that they continue to sell new Flex units to customers with bands but they don't take care of their existing customers. Heck, they've even come out with an entirely new product (the Force), but can't seem to supply a simple rubber band to an existing customer. I like the product but advise staying away from this company until they get their stuff together. Changing my review from 3 to 1 star because I paid $100 for something sitting in a drawer and am getting no sense of customer support from this company.",

Actually, funny story, after almost a year of using Fitbit Ones, somehow both my wife and I sent ours through the washing machine at the same time! We did the rice trick (put them in rice overnight, then try to start them again) and hers came back but mine never did. So I ordered the Flex to replace my One because I figured if I was wearing it around my wrist, I'd be less likely to send it through the wash. So far so good on that front: The Flex has never come close to going through the wash! However, where the Fitbit One offered a lot of nice features including a little LCD screen that would provide info on activity level, number of steps, number of staircases climbed, and time, the Fitbit Flex has five lights. The lights basically just tell you how close you are to achieving your step goal for the day. If you want to know any other info, you need to pull out your phone and check the app, which is kind of annoying. That said, the app is great. It's highly informative considering all you're really sending it is pedometer data from the Flex. It also lets you track things like water intake. It's true that the Flex has sleep tracking and that is a great feature of it. However, it's also a feature present on every other Fitbit, so it's not anything special. I do think the sleep tracking is quite interesting and useful, and I do use the device for that. However, I will note that while you're supposedly able to put it into sleep mode by tapping it repeatedly, when I've tried that, it does not work. Also, the app sometimes flubs up the sleep timer and I have to go in and manually change it after I've woken up. Not a huge problem, but a little bit of an annoyance. The real issue with the Flex at this point is that Fitbit has released the Fitbit Force at a slightly higher price point, but with a lot more features. The Force is basically a wrist-mounted Fitbit One. Had I known about the Force before acquiring my Flex, I would have waited to get the Force. Anyone considering the Flex, I recommend you look into the Fitbit Force and see if it isn't more interesting to you. The other thing is, while other companies are coming out with ever more dynamic and interesting physiological trackers (like Basis), but Fitbit does not yet have a lot of these metrics covered. The Fitbit is much cheaper, and that is to its benefit, but it would be nice to see a premium Fitbit not unlike the Basis. Bottom line is, I would have given the Fitbit Flex four stars if it weren't for the existence of the Fitbit Force. Given the Force is available for just $30 more, I feel it diminishes the value of the Flex substantially and highly recommend you look into that before making a purchase choice.",

            "review_text": "How do you motivate yourself with the least amount of effort possible? The Fitbit Flex is a pretty good answer. It's discreet, you charge it less than your cell phone, and it notifies you through interfaces you likely are already using everyday, like smartphone or web apps. All the while, it's passively counting your steps and letting you know how far away you are from your walking goal. Measuring progress is key to so many things in life. And with Fitbit, all you have to do is put on a bracelet. Fit also has some other features, such as sleep tracking, caloric intake, weight, and body fat. The sleep tracking is an OK feature to have, but having to tell your fit bit with a series of taps that you're going to sleep is a bit of a hassle (if you forget to put it in sleep mode, you can enter in the time you slept after you wake up and it'll still show your sleep patterns). But aside from slight movements and actual awake times, it doesn't give you a clearer picture of things like your heart rate or breathing patterns. Caloric intake is even more of a chore. To calculate it, you have to track everything you're eating. While there are resources that provide general estimations of what you're eating, and a list of foods that you eat regularly, having to input what you eat after every meal is tedious at best. If you do take that route, you can get a much clearer picture of what you need to do to reach your activity and weight goals, but miss a few days, and it's easy to lose track altogether. Lastly, if you purchase the Fitbit Aria scale, you can upload weight, body fat, and BMI measurements wirelessly to your Fitbit account. Now this feature does work like magic. Once it's set up, you simply step on the scale, and the data shows up in your app. That convenience comes at a price, however, at a hundred bucks a pop in addition to the flex, the combo can be price prohibitive. So why a two star review? Water resistance. For clothes it makes sense, walk in a storm, and you'll stay dry for the most part. The worst that can happen is you feel a little damp. For electronics it's a different story. Take it in the shower, it'll work. Take it for a long bath, and there goes your $100 investment down the drain. You get so used to using this thing that you forget you're wearing it, which can be both a blessing and a wasted investment. Long story short, great device, wonderful interface for it's key pedometer feature, a bit of a drag for everything else. Be smart about it and keep it dry, or you might end up with a dead Fitbit like mine. UPDATE: Shortly after I posted this review, I was contacted by fitbit. They asked me to try to reset my flex, and that didn't work. So they're shipping me a brand new Flex. And while that doesn't account for all the short comings of this device, the positive customer experience is enough to bump this review up another star.",

I'm not a tiny person and the small one fits fine with plenty of room left for adjusting smaller or larger so if you have any concerns about this fitting your wrist, you should be just fine.

After that, it has worked flawlessly. Just don't lay around so long that it thinks you're asleep. The sleep tracking is actually really accurate. I looked at my clock (11:38pm) when I went to bed. The fitbit then estimated that I fell asleep at (11:42pm). So, pretty darn accurate. But, if you are doing something with your hands, the best thing for you to do is put it in your pocket.

My initial satisfaction with the product has waned as the defects have become more pronounced. For anyone looking to purchase a Fitbit Force (the newest offering and one step up from the Flex), I would recommend holding out a bit longer and waiting to see if the defects are addressed. My experience thus far: PROS: * Excellent app; connects seamlessly with my Flex and my Aria (Fitbit scale). In the gym, I prefer tracking my activity with the app rather than the monitor on my gym's fitness equipment. * Sleep module; because it is measuring only activity, and not heart rate, I don't expect this to be 100 percent accurate. However, it has been interesting to see how long it takes me on average to fall asleep and how many times I wake up during the night. * Silent alarm; sometimes takes multiple attempts to set, but once this is done it works well. My husband also appreciates that I can get up before him and no longer need to set the alarm on my phone. CONS: * Faulty closure on the bracelet; mine has already slipped off my wrist several times, even though I have owned the product for only a few months. This is not an isolated issue. Check the FitBit FB page and you'll notice that most of the posts are from owners with complaints about this issue (applies to both the Flex and the Force). * [Edited] There is no way to import foods saved from the LoseIt app (although you can do so from MyFitness Pal) into the Fitbit app; you need to manually add any foods not already in the \"Common\" category. Also, no barcode scanner capability so entering new foods is rather onerous. TAKEAWAY Unless you are willing to take the risk of losing your Flex or Force, I recommend waiting until Fitbit addresses the faulty closure issue before you buy either one.",

            "review_text": "In a nutshell, the Fitbit Flex is an overpriced, marginally accurate pedometer with a few extra bells and whistles. It's useful in many ways, but also frustrating at times. I have to say there are a few features I haven't yet tried, but I've used it long enough to write a review. First, the cons: 1. The pedometer, or step counter feature, as I have said, is only marginally accurate. I have a decent pedometer which I know to be quite accurate and which I have used for some time. The Fitbit count averages probably 15-20% off. Sometimes it undercounts, usually the count is considerably over. That is probably because it is worn on the wrist, and if I scratch my head or talk using my non-dominant hand (where it is worn,) it counts as steps. At the end of the day, I can have some 2000 steps not recorded on my pedometer. If you push a cart in a market for 30 minutes, or walk pushing a baby stroller or carrying a bag in that hand, it tends to count very few steps. This can lead to a substantial undercount. If I walk with my hands free at my sides, the Fitbit and pedometer are almost completely in sync. 2. My Fitbit syncs with My Fitness Pal, a valuable feature. However, it tends to exaggerate the extra calories I am entitled to from exercise. If I ate back all the extra calories Fitbit tells me I have burned, I would probably gain a pound or so a week. 3. The battery has to be charged about every 5 days, a bit of a nuisance. My pedometer is not rechargeable, is larger and has fewer features, but the batteries last a long, long time. 4. The flex is very small, so there is no readable display, so you have to read results elsewhere. You can gain some info from the lights, but they can be a bit of a nuisance to figure out. Pros: 1. It is small, easy to wear, and can be worn in the shower, though it can be a bit difficult to put on, especially for an older person. 2. The wireless sync with the computer is nice, and allows you to get a lot of information (even when it's not always as accurate as I might like.) It's also nice that it syncs with My Fitness Pal. This saves a lot of time (but see the caveat above) 3. I especially like the sleep evaluation feature. I feel that this is giving me a pretty accurate picture of my sleep patterns, and the sleep efficiency rating is helpful. I have enjoyed my Fitbit Flex and the feedback it gives has helped motivate me. Would I buy it again? I'm not sure. I might try a different Fitbit model. The negatives I have noted above, even though I compensate for them as much as possible, still irritate me at times.",

Things were going wonderfully for about the first 4 months that I owned it. The battery life was great, about 5 days or so between charges, and I never had an issue with the unit. Then everything went downhill. I first started noticing problems when I had a hard time getting the unit to charge. I had to forcefully place it in the charge cable and I had to stand the charge cable upright because the unit would fall out of it or lose contact with the connectors. This went on for a couple months and then all of a sudden the unit would not charge at all. I tried cleaning the connectors like Fitbit had recommended and that did not work either. Luckily for me I found a customer service phone number online(they don't publish a support phone number anywhere on the packaging or their website) and they sent me a new unit. The customer service person was very polite and apologized for the defective unit and gladly sent me a new one. Also, my wife bought one of these a couple months after me and she just started having the same problems about a month ago. First the lights on the front of hers were going in and out and then she had the same charging issues. Just this week hers has stopped charging all together and we are going to have to call and get hers replaced as well. To sum it up, I love the Fitbit Flex when it works. It really did make me realize how little I was moving and motivated me to get up and walk and run to reach my goal. That said I feel like if I am going to spend $100 on not much more than a smart pedometer then it should not cease working within 6 months.",

Bought a new band because the old one was tearing where you put the unit in. Started tracking food/calories again. October 31-November 3 I went away. Charged it overnight before I left. Next day, it stopped working again. I charged it overnight. Next morning, lights are on, it's working, put it in the wristband, stops working. Charged overnight again. Repeat this for three days, during which it was active long enough to tally a few hundred steps before dying. This is a neat toy but way too glitchy. I'll go back to my Omron pedometer, which only fails when the battery dies! **UPDATE December 2014: I emailed FitBit and received a prompt reply, requesting proof of purchase and with a questionnaire. I responded with a PDF of my receipt, answered the questions, then received an email telling me that a replacement was on its way to me.

I still have the old one in case FitBit gets around to wanting it back, but there were no instructions to return the faulty one. I'm very impressed with FitBit's commitment to customer satisfaction and their promptness with replacing the unit...I wish I had reached out to them sooner when I realized it wasn't working right!",

Can't get it into \"sleep\" mode and am offended by the \"forget to log your sleep\" question on my dashboard. The battery doesn't stay charged as long. And, biggest loss, it doesn't tell time so one needs a watch as well on some occasions when having a cell phone is inappropriate. On a positive note, the clasp works great so at least that problem appears two have been fixed. The weekly stats sent by fitbit are encouraging. And, when you log in food consumption etc. the reports on calories in/out are grand. But, this has a long way to go to match the quality of the FORCE. Pretty colors do not a grand device make",

Unfortunately, the hardware issue they have is a significant one and one that is causing me to return for refund my FitBit Flex. The Flex tracker should plug into the charging cable (like any other electronic device) and simply charge. Plug it, leave it, come back to charged tracker. Unfortunately for the Flex tracker I was sent, that never happened for me. I followed all the suggestions they have on their site (which indicates they are well aware of the charging issues). The only thing that (occasionally) worked was to put the tracker in the charging cable and manuever a paperclip to make it even more secure. That would work only sometimes and not ever for a full charge. The Flex tracker just does not charge properly. Upon my third inquiry to FitBit on this (and realize they do not have phone or chat support -- email support ONLY), they said my tracer's battery voltage was not working properly but because I was outside the 45 day purchase window they would not refund. Thus, 2 stars is being generous for what the FitBit can do (if/when it is charged), but the hardware itself is fatally flawed (hopefully for them on the manufacturing side and not design side) and their support is quite lacking. One should look to a competitor and not FitBit.",

It allowed me to track steps, sleep, food and water intake and other activities if I chose to. I could check my progress daily. Just after six months of use, the battery started fading very quickly. Even with the \"approved and official\" charging plug, the device wouldn't take a charge. I followed the trouble-shooting advice online. Apparently it didn't work. Not only did the device TOTALLY lose its charge, the program didn't even send me a warning that my battery was low. (The syncing started missing this battery problem several weeks ago. The dashboard showed the battery fully powered, the device reported something else.) I have contacted Fitbit to see if they will replace the device under their \"365 day\" warranty. But really, even if they do, will I need to replace this thing in another seven months? I am not an intense athlete who abused this device, just an older adult who used this primarily to track walks with my dog. For the price and the hype this device has received, I would expect it to last longer than 7 months. Will report back when I hear from the Fitbit warranty people. In the meantime, I'm checking out other devices. UPDATE: Fitbit is now \"determining\" my eligibility for replacement. I have sent them my amazon invoice as proof of payment and they asked me to send my proof of payment AGAIN! I'm hoping that this is just an overlap of emails, but it seems a bit odd that they've asked twice. Also, we determined that the charging cable doesn't work either. The product continues to disappoint. We'll see if they can turn it around. UPDATE 2: Fitbit finally decided to replace my non-working device. However, they use the SLOWEST shipping method available. So while I'm paying for their premium membership on my Fitbit, I've effectively been without the device for more than a week. I doubt they will provide a credit for lost time. Still waiting for the replacement to arrive. So far it's been in transit for five days. What a headache!",

(I'm overweight, 71, and have arthritis). After a few days, I noticed that I was tending to be less \"efficient\" in my activities - I am a master at avoiding steps; and habitually loaded grocery bags all over my arms to avoid having to walk back to the car. Less efficient, obviously = more steps. And this let me see just how much difference a few steps here and there throughout the day could make. After several months - as my daily average kept moving up slowly, I also started logging my food (a very complete list of items automatically comes up on your screen when you type in something like \"coffee\" or \"bread\"). It's easy to do, and I lost about 4 pounds in two weeks (much of which I'm sure was water, but I was glad to get rid of it anyway! I'm devoted to my Fitbit, so when I lost it somewhere on my weekly grocery shopping trip with my daughter, I was hearbroken. (The wrist band is my only reservation: it can be difficult to fasten securely if you have arthritis). When I emailed them, they asked for some information, and to my surprise they just wrote to say that a replacement is on its way. How cool is that??? My only suggestion is that you think carefully about the most secure model for you: the Flex comes with two wrist bands of different sizes; or a clip-on model, which I think you can also wear around your neck. It has capabilities that I haven't tapped into yet, but so far this strikes me as a brilliant basic tool for helping you be mindful of \"energy expended\" vs. \"caloric intake\". I love it!",

Fitbit is demanding proof of purchase to replace it, which could be a real problem if the Fitbit were a gift or you didn't order through Amazon or another online merchant where you have an account. Proof of purchase also seems silly given that for the Fitbit to work, you have to register with Fitbit and obtain an account with Fitbit.

I use this with my \"myfitnesspal/MFP\" acct and it sync's to it and adjusts my calories and all that jazz, so I don't log my food on the fitbit because I do that on MFP instead. I also went into my MFP acct and allowed fitbit to have my calories adjusted in the negative (this is not a default setting, you must do this-must do on website not app). If you work-out then in MFP will have you to tell it the exact time and for how long and it'll make adjustments so you won\u2019t have an error increase on your calories usage (MFP will make all the adjustments in calories for you) Pretty cool. I know people have remarked that it's not calculating their steps correctly so they then put it on their ankles. The fitbit is a pretty sophisticated device, it's not just about counting steps but rather movement. You can put it on your non-dominant wrist or adjust it to be less or more sensitive if you've got issues that way. For example when I'm walking into work I'm always carrying stuff in the same arm that the fitbit is on and it knows I'm walking and counts my steps (I opened my app with my other hand and just watched it count the steps) then I go to talk to someone and use my arm (hand talking...) that has the fitbit BUT it didn't count the steps because it knew I wasn't walking or major movement. Pretty awesome device if you ask me. The only time it didn\u2019t count my steps was pushing a shopping cart and I put it in my pocket and it resumed. So carts, strollers are an issue, so put it in your pocket or in shoelaces, ankle... I also really like the sleep monitoring too. Overall It's a real eye-opener to self-awareness on if you're sleeping and are as active as you think you are. The app gives a lot of info on the fly but if you want to know the exact time then go to your acct on the website and the graph will break it down by the hour rather a window of hours.",

I purchased this item in black. I was a pre-order customer, so I ordered it in March and received the FitBit on May 21st. By July, I had to send you a message that my tracker was not charging properly. It took days for someone to get back to me- by then I had managed to charge it by physically holding it in place in the charger and tying a rubber band around it. So the email reply I got from FitBit service was \u201cwe see your fitbit has been charged and synced.\u201d No help at all. So then I purchased a second charger- at $25- thinking maybe it was that. I had my IT department check my USB ports on my computer. I tried using my husband\u2019s computer. I tried using a MAC instead of a PC. I tried using a USB hub. I tried cleaning it per your instructions. I tried resetting it per your instructions. Nothing worked. There are dozens of negative reviews on Amazon.com from FitBit users who are having the same problem. You really need to rethink the charging mechanism, as well as the design of the bands- all of mine are tearing now where the rubber part meets the window on the inside part of the band- I guess when you pop the tracker out to charge it or to change the band color, this puts wear and tear on the band. I purchased replacement bands (blue, orange, navy) only 6 weeks ago, and already the orange and navy are torn. My black one is also torn and I have had to use the large size black band ever since. I am so disappointed- the FitBit has been a great motivator and I love using it with my RunKeeper app- but the quality of the accessories and the charging situation really need to be revisited by you all. Please advise what you plan to do next to remedy the situation. If this is a fitbit flex issue, I will even agree to send this one back and pay only the difference for a fitbit force if you think the force may not have all these issues. I don\u2019t want to deal with another flex if I am going to have all these same problems two months after normal use.",

I will admit, when I first got it, it took about a week to get used to. Here's a tip: if you set your MFP profile to sedentary or active or whatever, make sure your fit bit is set the same so that the calories count is more accurate. No matter what, MFP and Fit Bit are always about 50 calories off each other in regards to how many I have left for the day. Also, Fit Bit projects how many calories you will burn in a day based on your activity level, height, age and weight and you work down, if that makes sense. So sometimes, I may show I have 500 calories left based on what I am projected to burn, but then I may take a nap in the afternoon on a weekend and not burn as many as I usually do. So the next day when I look at my progress from the day before, it may say I ate 50-100 calories over when at the time of me eating it told me I had enough calories. The thing to remember is that this is a tool to help. Not a 100% accurate count of calories, though it is pretty darn close. Also, I look at it like a game. Each morning I wake up to see how many calories I burned and find out if I \"won the game\" of making to my 750 calorie deficit. So far after one month of using Fit Bit, tracking eating calories in MFP and walking about 30 minutes four days a week, I have lost about 6 pounds. (I loathe working out and never stick to it, but found that I really enjoy walking.) I love being able to check my progress throughout the day and see that my walk into work burned 60 calories, or my errand to another building on campus burned 100. It really is a great motivator. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs some motivation.",

One of my favorite features is the sleep tracker, it's quite accurate at determining when you are tossing and turning and when you are definitely up and awake. I also like \"silent\" alarm which works by gently vibrating to wake you up in the morning. I would give it five stars if the wristband had been designed better. It's really difficult to get it to clasp correctly on your wrist, it's very awkward to put on. I've had it come off after getting hooked on something in my gym bag--I didn't even notice it at first--thankfully it fell into my bag and not on the street somewhere.

WTF?!? The charger has totally sucked from the get go but it is to the point that I haven't even been able to charge it for the last few days...but what's the point when the band has broken anyways & it's not like I'm going to shell out the money for replacements on either!!! For something that cost nearly $100 I might have well wiped my @ss with a Ben Franklin. That is all. UPDATE BUMPED UP TO 3 STARS 09/22/14: Like many people who have reviewed FitBit with one star, I received an email immediately from the manufacturer apologizing and recommending that I contact customer service (I kinda feel bad for whoever got stuck with this job since there seems to be A LOT of people in my position!)...I figured nothing to lose so I did via the website email on 9/9/14. Upon submission, I received an automatic acknowledgement that my inquiry had been received within 24 hours (9/10/14). I didn't hear back from them until a week later (9/16/14) with a request for a copy of my receipt (easy since I purchased it on Amazon) and a few other informational items and let me know that my case would be evaluated and they \"may provide a replacement as a measure of good will\". The following day (9/17/14) I received an email thanking me for providing the requested information and was notified that a new FitBit was being processed...and I just received my replacement today (9/22/14)!!! I have seen a lot of reviews that have complained about the customer service. While I think the initial response back asking for additonal information took a week and it was still a total bummer that my original one lasted 6 weeks - I don't have any complaints with my overall customer service experience. I definitely think that that less than two weeks to receive a replacement is pretty awesome!!! So I bumped my review up to 3 stars because I loved my FitBit before it broke...that being said I have yet to try my new FitBit out but recommend that anyone with an issue should most definitely contact FitBit customer service (especially since the Amazon return policy is only 30 days). Hope this one isn't a LEMON too...crossing fingers!!!",

The Fitbit itself is awesome, but the manufacturer needs to do something about these charger issues. Other than that problem (but it is a doozy) I would have given this tracker 5 stars. Now I am off to read reviews to see what I can replace this useless tracker with. I can assure you it will not be with any device that uses this type of charger - am not sure that it will even be a Fitbit product. Sad.",

You can tap the Fitbit at any time and check your progress, but I noticed that it didn't light up at all. After tapping it several times and even taking it out of the band it finally lit up. The next day it stopped working all together so I checked their help section on their website. It suggested that I try to restart the Fitbit. Tried that and it didn't work. So I contacted their customer service, they could tell that my device was acting abnormally so they asked for my receipt, shipping details and contact information. I now have a brand new Fitbit being sent to me and they asked that I recycle my old one. I am extremely impressed with how promptly my issue was handled.

I have read and reread and reread the directions: they are confusing, unclear, and poorly written. I have downloaded the software three times in the hope its performance might improve. HOWEVER, it has not worked since day one. The silent alarm goes off at random times. The light display does not always match the desired function. The battery does not always charge and may take several attempts. The sleep mode readouts are funky and inconsistent: today, I learned that I slept 19 hours and 50 minutes? I don't trust the sleep outcomes. Where is the science behind that function? You have not demonstrated any methodology. Was this item ever tested? If so, why don't you share the testing results. Water gets in the Fitbit pocket when I take a shower and stays there: that can't be good even though you assure me it is OK. The clasp for the band is very sexy but very difficult to use. $100 was far too much to pay for something that has performed so poorly. On the plus side, it is a good idea and I appreciate the emails concerning my progress. Taking the long view, Microsoft set a modern manufacturing trend that only gets worse as time passes. They put out software that did not work and they knew it. Operative policy: Pay full price for an inadequate product, we promise it will get better. Quality standards have continued to be compromised for profit motive. The Fitbit falls into this pattern quite comfortably, it seems. Good idea, too expensive, poor performance, and no recourse for resolution. Look up the meaning of, \"a pig in a poke\".

I've already gone through one but I guess it's not too bad since I work the thing pretty hard. The only other thing that bothers me is when I ride my bike it goes in and out of sleep constantly due to the bumps. It doesn't track the rride and that doesn't bother me at all. I just have to take it off now and throw it in my bag when I ride to keep it from going in and out of sleep mode. One of the features I love is the silent alarm.

I used to have the fitbit one which I liked except for the fact that it had to be clipped on and you couldn't wear it in the water. I wanted something I can just keep on that is easy to sleep in and this fits my needs. The band is a little hard to get on in that the metal fits very tight into the slots. It may loosen over time. The sleep tracker works by tapping the top of the case several times until it starts vibrating, then 2 lights show up. You stop sleep tracker the same way. I also like this version of the Flex because you can set alarms on it. If you have to take medication at the same time everyday, you can set the alarm to always vibrate at that time on a particular day of the week or all days if you want. You can set multiple alarms to vibrate on multiple days. That will suck your battery if you go to crazy with it but so far, my battery is fine.",

Without a charge, the fitbit is virtually not useable. Of course I could buy another charger, but why should I have to buy a new charger after only 32 days? I believe the system should allow you access to the seller through your account of past orders indefinitely. This is the only item that has ever disappeared off of my past order list in my account ever. I think that is unacceptable. I bought it, and it should remain in my history. Why does the seller ( or ?) have the ability to remove the sell history from my account, or why does Amazon remove it without my request?

The first thing you need to do before you use the Flex is set up an account on fitbit.com. In order to do so, the device must be charged and display at least three power bars. As instructed by the setup program, I removed the fitbit module from strap and put it in the USB charging dock. I tried charging it in 3 different devices with USB ports. It never indicated that it had any power and would not charge. After attempting to charge it for about 45 minutes and failing, I did an internet search and found a video that showed a design flaw that required that a paperclip be placed in the charging dock to force the fitbit module to make contact with the contacts in the charging dock. I saw in the video that it worked. However, it did not work for me. I decided to return it partly because of the apparent design flaw and partly because I liked the display features and ease of use with the Charge HR. I am returning the Flex and buying another Charge HR.",

Any movement involving your wrist- taking off a jacket for example, will make the band pop right off!

            "review_text": "As a frequent long distance runner I think this product isn't too bad, but has some major flaws to it. First thing that I hate most about it is the fact that if you shake, move, or basically anything that will make it THINK that you're walking, it'll count it as steps. For example typing, writing, and jerking your hand. I Sat all day one day on the computer, ended the day telling me I walked 2-3 miles...uhh I certainly didn't. For this problem I personally keep it in my pocket and only put it on my wrist when I run,but it's a wristband, that's the whole point, I shouldn't be putting it in my pocket! Second, when tracking sleep you CAN'T just go to bed and automatically know you're sleeping, you have to go on the Fitbit app to start tracking sleep, not to mention you also have to tell your phone when you wake up or it'll keep tracking it as \"restless sleep\". Third, when you want to track and log your runs or exercise sessions, SAME with the sleeping. CAN'T just go off for a run and expect it to know you were running. You have to inform that you're going to exercise with your phone. YES you can go running without the phone, it'll just increase your steps and active minutes. you CAN log in exercise manually and \"guess\" how long or far you ran. If you want more accurate log you have to have your phone for that. It CAN track with GPS where you start and end, how many miles, pace, and mile splits, BUT you have to have run with you're phone. To track all that it needs cellar data to know where you start, it WILL keep tracking if you run somewhere with no connection and still know where you ran, but it only will if you start somewhere with cellar data. Tracking how much you eat is pretty accurate, but can be a bit of a pain to log every time you eat. I don't want to make this too long, so I'll end by saying that overall it's all about the Fitbit app, while there's a small tracker that is placed in a piece of plastic. As a runner who runs 6-7 days a week....It's ok, personally for ME the Fitbit Zip is WAY BETTER UPDATE!!!! STOPPED CHARGING AND IT'S ONLY SEPTEMBER!!!! only LASTED me ~FIVE WEEKs!! NO DON'T BUY",

It also implies any movement at night as \"restless\", when shifting position during sleep is normal and necessary. The user interface of single tapping, double tapping and rapid tapping is ridiculous when bumping and vibration during work causes these functions to activate and deactivate spontaneously. The wristband clasp is a challenge to attach often requiring a second set of hands. This wouldn't be a problem if you didn't have to remove the wristband every few days to charge the fitbit unit. If you wear a watch on your non-dominate hand, forget about it; it was constantly pushing buttons on my digital watch whenever my wrist would bend.

If he deliberately held his arm straight down, it would not show a step. If you swing your arm really big it will show a false step, but things like washing dishes didn't show as a step. When I use it on the treadmill, I put it on my ankle. I would think if your ankle was too big you could attach it to your shoelace. One word of caution, I accidentally put it in sleep mode while shaking a bottle of nail polish. It's fun to watch your progress.

The time I spend on the elliptical exerciser at the gym apparently gets counted, I'm happy to say. The feedback on sleep is interesting and may be helpful. It does detect restlessness at night and it detects that you are awake if you actually get out of bed, but it does not detect wakefulness if you are lying quietly in bed. Even though it is not 100% accurate on sleep, it is useful to get some feedback on duration and quality of sleep. It took a couple of days to learn just how many times to tap to turn the sleep counter on and off, and sometimes I forget to turn it off which messes up the record. I find it best to not take it too seriously. At age 76, I don't plan to try to push myself to 10,000 steps per day (5000 to 7000 is about right for me). The only thing I do not like is the clasp on this gadget. The prongs have to be lined up perfectly with the holes before I can squeeze them into place.

The original bracelet clasp is almost impossible to close by yourself, but you can buy a replacement bracelet or clip really cheap and really cute anyways. Your steps are counted even on a treadmill, but you can't hold the bar with the hand your wearing the bracelet on,however, your steps will be counted if your hand is still though, like if your texting. I've read comments that you can wear it on your shoe or leg for spinning, but your not walking when your spinning, so your really cheating if you do this anyway. Especially for bone health, you want to perform weight bearing exercise, so don't worry about spinning not being counted. With the app, you can manually add other forms of exercise, and you can add your food. The food app is insane, I entered a protein cookie that is so rare and they even had it in there database. Your food entries get deducted from your total calories so every time you eat you can see how many calories you have left. This is also the only fitbit that can be replaced with cute bands, necklaces, or clips for your bra or shoe, so even though the more expensive Fitbits seem great they really aren't that attractive for women.

You can track your water in take, calories, and weight too. This is definitely getting me to exercise more and it's so fun to watch through the app.",

I do have a little trouble setting it from the active mode to the sleep mode. It doesn't switch as easily back and forth as it is supposed to. The directions for setting up the Fitbit on the computer and phone are pretty easy to follow. It seems to be pretty accurate regarding the sleep record, as I have looked at the clock when I wake up in the middle of the night and reflects on the record how long I am awake and what time. If you think you have been active during the day, you can tell by the footsteps you have taken and the miles \"walked\". You would be amazed at how it actually motivates you to get up and move. It is interesting to find out exactly how active or \"inactive\" you have been for a day!!! I really like the fact that you can wear it all of the time even while swimming and in the shower. Be sure and purchase extra colorful wristbands to interchange with outfits. This is what I am giving for Christmas gifts. UPDATE-UPDATE 3/9/2015 When my fitbit quit working after a couple of months and would not hold a charge, I was so disappointed. Not being one to complain, I did however call the company and they knew exactly what I was talking about and how many times I had tried to charge it. The company could see from their computer response that it was not holding the charge. To solve this, the wonderful customer relations person said they would send me a new one. I got it within the week, and it is working great. I am now wearing it again full time. It is charging up nicely. From this experience with the company, I ordered four more for Christmas presents. With the exception of one, each recipient is enjoying and wearing the fitbit. It certainly makes me more aware of my activity. I am seriously considering ordering the fitbit with the watch included. Good product and I would definitely order it again.",

            "review_text": "This is my first digital fitness tracker. After about three weeks of use I can say that it mostly works as advertised. It's step detection during walking is accurate but there are a few problems. First, it misses steps during sprints on the treadmill. Second, it is not useful on the elliptical trainer since I hold on to the handles to stabilize myself. It worked reasonably well when I tucked it inside the top of my socks while on the elliptical. The sleep function is rudimentary. It doesn't actually tell you (it can't) whether you slept well or not. It acts as an actigraph, simply recording how much you moved during sleep. If you lay still while awake, the Fitbit would show you as sleeping. As an indicator of restlessness, it is probably reasonable. The synchronization with a smartphone is excellent and a great way to check your goals. The web interface is good as well. The food intake tracker doesn't work well for me as it won't allow me to go enter the previous day's meals and there is no way to enter a meal and adjust the date backwards. Finally, the quality of the wristband is poor. In just three weeks, there is a split in the band even though I always take it off when I shower and avoid getting it wet. Almost certainly I will need to replace the band soon. UPDATE: I emailed FitBit about the crack in the wristband and they have promised to replace it, though I have not yet received the replacement. Today I started having charging problems with my device. When I put it into the cradle and plug it in, the LED flashes once then goes off. I thought maybe the battery was too low so left it alone for an hour. Still no lights came on (it is supposed to flash when charging). When I gently push the FitBit into the cradle and hold it, the lights flash as they are supposed to showing charging. As soon as I let it go, the device goes dead. I have cleaned the contacts but the problem seems to be with the fit of the device into the cradle. I have tried two different cradles with the same result.",

So... a bit annoyed because I have to either buy the wrist band I want separately or wait to ship this one back and have a replacement sent. Edited to add: Ok, so the wristband issue was taken care of by fitbit customer support/amazon and I was a pretty happy camper. In fact, I LOVE my flex. PROS 1. It tracks fairly accurately. I wear it on my non-dominant wrist with sensitivity set to normal. I tested it by wearing my regular old pedometer simultaneously for the first few days, then comparing the step counts. The two devices register <100 steps difference on any given day. 2. Since I can wear it in the shower, I don't ever forget it, because it's always on my wrist. 3. The fitbit dashboard, apps, community, etc. are excellent! 4. It has motivated me so much over the past month - I really want to get all those lights solid every day. CONS 1. I've been using it just over a month, and it stopped holding a charge for longer than a day, even though background sync is turned off. 2. It has stopped syncing correctly, and I have had to reset it several times over the past few days. 3. I noticed a rather good sized crack in the flex near the charging contact points - this despite that I have taken very good care of it: I take it off when I swim in the ocean (avoid salt), I take it off when I wash dishes (avoid hot water), and have only ever cleaned it by rubbing it gently with a cotton ball. It has also always been kept in the wristband or the charging cradle. 4. I wonder if it was a used/returned flex, because when I set it up, it had data in it from February, and it was only delivered to me on August 12. At any rate, not too keen on spending $100 on a used device that breaks after a month.",

If you are looking for a tracker, I STRONGLY suggest the Fitbit One. The Fitbit One does everything this Flex doesn't; i.e., it works properly. Although I've only had it 3 days, I am returning it. That may seem like too short of a time to give it a fair review, but I would have to disagree. I own the Fitbit One and it was a snap to use right out of the box. I have never experienced a single problem with it. I was hoping the Flex would work as flawlessly, but, not so much. Let me describe the problems I've had since I received it. 1. I could not get the band to stay closed on my wrist. I had to have someone else snap it closed as it does not snap together easily. 2. I initially could not get it sync. I actually had to google \"how to get my Fitbit Flex to sync\" because I could not get it to work with the directions given on the Fitbit site. This may sound like I'm incompetent, but I had no problems with my Fitbit One. 3. It doesn't track my steps accurately. It routinely indicates that I have walked less than half the steps I typically walked using my One - even after adjusting for stride length. 4. I could not get it log sleep at all, even though I followed the instructions. 5. It won't sync unless the device is right over the dongle - seriously, within 6 inches. The One would sync just about anywhere in my house. 6. Also annoying is the fact that you have to see your results on the computer or phone app if you have the right kind of phone. The list of phones is very small and as of my purchase, it was not available for the HTC Evo. The device DOES NOT display your steps - you will have to sync each time to see your results. I never had to manually tell my One to sync, it did so on it's own. I give it two stars because I do like the design and fit once the device is actually on.",

Recently, I've been trying to keep fit by eating healthier and exercising, so this was a neat little gadget that helped me track everything that I would like to know. The thing that really got me to purchase this was for the sleep tracker. It works pretty well; telling me my points of restlessness throughout my night. I also love the Silent alarms, which surprisingly work well with me, as I am a relatively hard sleeper. Going onto the tracker itself, it is small, so if you ever do take it out of the band for some reason and lose it, it could be hard to find again. Thankfully, it is tough to lose because the band holds it extremely well and the only times you really need to take it out are to either clean it or to charge it. The battery life on the tracker is amazing. I charge it every 4 or so days and it charges pretty quickly. The band feels very good. Most times, I forget that I even have it on! The color options are also great, I must say. I've heard people say that the band breaks easily, though I cannot say the same. You just need to watch out for it, just like anything else that you wear. The only things that I have to say that could use improvement is sometimes the tracker is a little too sensitive and goes onto sleep mode if I am biking or lifting anything. Maybe instead of tapping it for 2 seconds or so there could be an alternative to disable that or a pattern. All in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase and I suggest it to anyone that is looking for a handy tracker! Definitely worth the money.",

I work out 6 days a week and purchased this device because I am breastfeeding and need to stay on top of my calories, so accuracy is pretty important. I have to log most of my exercises and go into another app I have to manually count calories on some exercises (yoga, dance and fusion workouts) All that aside, I would recommend the device.

I love checking online to see how many calories I have consumed and how many I have left. Maybe enough for a glass of wine? I love the customer service and support and the over-the-top solution provided when I ran into a bit of trouble - - once. I now walk a minimum of 10K per day - - even in the hottest triple digit summer days in Arizona (malls are great for these days). I feel better, went off of my blood pressure meds (with my physician's approval) and no longer have nagging hip and knee pain. I bought another color band just to mix it up, and plan to treat myself again when I reach another weight loss milestone. Terrific product.",

There are hundreds (if not thousands) of communities that you can join to compare progress or use their built-in forums. I only have a couple complaints. First, I think the food database needs some work. I used Lose It previously and was incredibly satisfied. Fortunately, Fitbit integrates with Lose It so I can continue to use that service, but I would prefer Fitbit to simply bolster their offering. Second, I think Fitbit missed the boat on the Badges system. For the Flex there are really only two badges that you can earn in increasing amounts- badges for steps and miles traveled. Gamification isn't exactly a new concept and many competitors implement it better. Overall I am incredibly satisfied with my purchase.

Because the One had a tendency to pop-off fro wherever I had it clipped on I was anxious to give the Flex a try - after several months with the Flex and despite the convenience in wearing it, I go back to the One if I could make a direct swap. The Flex's Pros - Convenience - the wristband is great and so is being able to wear it almost all the time; Tracking - it tracks almost as many things as the One; the Alarm - I get up to exercise early every morning and the vibrating alarm awakens me without disturbing my wife. The Flex's Cons - Compared to the One's screen information the display on the Flex is virtually worthless; where the One gives you steps, miles, time, recent activity intensity level, flights of stairs climbed and calories burned at the touch of a button, the Flex merely gives you five lights - each one representing 20% of your daily steps goal, and gives you no further indications of progress if you exceed your goal (you can check your Fitbit account's dashboard for detailed activity information). You can also get other data about your activity (expect for flights of stairs - no altimeter) from your dashboard, but that's not near as convenient as being able to spot check as you go. All-in-all the Flex is fine for tracking your activity - on the dashboard - but not real good for spot checking how you are doing as your day progresses. I'd love to see Fitbit develop a tracker that combined the best of both devices. If you need the convenience of an easily worn device that tracks and can report activity information to your Fitbit account; and aren't particularly interested in knowing how you're doing as the day goes along the Flex will serve you pretty well. If you're looking for a device to help keep you motivated to stay active throughout the day, the One is a much better choice.",

This device had extra functions I was excited about such as sleep tracking and the ability to add additional exercise like biking. I was not sure the tracking of steps was accurate because the miles the gym's treadmill said was not the same as what the fitbit recorded.

I think the Fitbit Flex gets a lot of things right, but I am sorely disappointed with the build quality. I will say, though, the customer support has been excellent. I've had this only 7 months and I'm already on my third silicone band. The first one developed an unsightly bulge (took about 3 months) around where the fitbit actually sits in the wrist band, which also caused the fitbit to feel insecure in the band. The company sent a replacement free of charge that clearly feels heavier/sturdier like the silicone is more rigid. I think that extra rigidity caused the second failure. That replacement band separated from the plastic window (where the little white LEDs are visible) in less than two months. Guess they need stronger glue. Again, this was replaced free of charge to me. I'm on my third band now and so far, so good. I'm not hard on this thing--I just wear it as intended. Although it is shower safe, I always take it off anyway. Someone who might be harder or more demanding may find the quality issues more problematic. Unfortunately, the band isn't the only thing that is poorly built. The fitbit \"bean\" that fits into the band needs charged and a USB charging dock/dongle is included for this purpose. This little USB dock/dongle is clearly failing as well--when I plug it in, I have to play around with the positioning of the charging device to get it to actually charge. It is only a matter of time until this piece completely fails. I'll be contacting customer service to hopefully get this replaced because without it, the fitbit will be completely useless. Other than the mediocre built quality, I do enjoy the features. It is a good pedometer, I really like tracking my sleep quality, and the integration with my iPhone makes using it super easy.",

You can also input what you eat and drink so you can keep track of calories consumed, but I would rather write my food down in a journal than use the fitbit. The fitbit can be a great tool for weight loss as long as you keep track of the calories you are consuming. You'll be able to know if you can drink that beer or margirita! The other stuff it tracks is cool, but I dont care much about how many steps I have taken and feel the step tracker, miles walked, or very active minutes are more of a novelty. I know when I'm doing cardio I am \"very active.\" Also, the steps may be a bit off because a move of the wrist will usually count as a step even when you didnt step, but I feel it doesn't stray too far from accurate. Sleep tracker is neat too, and my fiance and I both love the vibrating alarm so we don't wake each other up with an awful alarm (she has a fitbit too).",

I can track my steps or calories burned, my food, water, sleep, most active minutes, etc. AND it is all synched wirelessly to my Droid and Mac...what a great thing! It's devilishly deceiving...I check my progress, and toward the end of the day if I haven't yet reached my daily goal, I go out of my way to \"feed the BEAST\" and burn more calories or walk further to meet my goal! When I go above and beyond my goals, and I look at the dashboard report on the Mac, it pops up with giant green happy faces to let me celebrate my achievements! How cool is that?? Plus I can earn achievement rewards, for example, 20,000 steps in one day. This is just too much fun. My buddies always ask me how THE BEAST is doing - LOL! I need to recharge it about every 5 days, and...wait for it...IT SENDS ME A NOTICE TO MY PHONE THAT THE BATTERY IS LOW! Also sends me an email to my Mac! This makes me love it even more. Got used to the feel of the wristband pretty quickly, and it's not so difficult now to close it but it did take some getting used to. Looks good, is waterproof, won't come off the wrist unless wrestling with gorillas, and keeps me aware of my daily progress in an unobtrusive way. Yep, I love it!",

Gave it ANOTHER full charge, took it off of the charger, now it doesn't work AT ALL. I have tried to contact Fitbit customer service with no resolution.

            "review_text": "I purchased a fitbit flex in April 2014. I really love the app and the function on the device. However, I believe the quality of these devices is worth considering. Fitbit suggests that the device can be worn in the water. I do not recommend it. I remove it before showering, swimming and try to avoid getting it wet. I have seen other reviews stating that the device died after using it in water. Plus you'll want to make sure the internal pocket of the bracelet is kept dry to avoid mold. I've had to replace a my bracelet to prevent this issue - and it's expensive to replace it more than once. Accuracy is not a strong feature of fitbit. It you choose to wear it during step aerobics, zumba, and the like. It does not accurately track your steps. The additonal arm movements some how change the responsiveness of the device. I have a few workout videos that are labled as 1, 2, 3 mile workouts. Although I believe it is true the workouts are always this exact milage. I could do the same workout on 3 different days and get 3 - vastly - different results using the fitbit. Same with cycling. Although the fitbit isnt suggested for cycling activity since I wear it all the time I was curious of the response. One day it tracked about 1/3 of my ride. The next time none of my ride was tracked. I dont care if it tracks it or not - I just want it to be more accurate and consistent. I have to factory reset the device often to keep it functional. Overall I am disappointed that a $100 device that is intended to be worn all the time doesnt have much stamina. After only 4 months I have a hit or miss device that I've purchased 2 additional bracelets for - because they get nasty despite regular cleaning. $150ish and 4 months it's already to find a new device. It will not be a fitbit. Look for quality over popularity",

            "review_text": "Update September 2015. After wearing it and loving it every day for about 9 months, my fitbit started periodically faulting out. No communication, loses memory of my activity. Now I can't wear it for more than a few hours before it faults out. Very frustrating. Downgrading to 3 stars. I love my fitbit! It was a little embarrassing when I first got it (apparently, I was a slug,) but it gave me the incentive to not spend so much time sitting down at home. I've had it now for several weeks and rarely meet my step goal, but I have increased my activity level quite a bit, so I'm on track. Once the weather cools off, i'll start daily walking and expect to meet the goal more frequently. Helpful comments: 1. It tracks activity via hand movements. It actually records vigorous hand washing as \"very active\" time. 2. It tracks my sleep. I learned I get less sleep than I thought. I also learned that the more active I am, the more I sleep, and the less I sleep, the less energy I have. So even though I'm too tired to exercise, I have been forcing myself to move, and it's helping. 3. OK, it's plastic. Not very attractive as-is. BUT - with superglue, a toothpick, and some very tiny rhinestones, I have (almost) a fashion statement. I'll post a photo later. 4. Has a very nice cell phone app, and an even nicer computer app. Helps you track all your health stats, and keeps a nice historical record. 5. You can link to (and cheer on) your friends. I'm now linked to three other people. When one of us has a very active day, we cheer them on. Increases all of our incentive to get moving.",

Pros: Comfortable fit, good design, excellent notifications, sleep tracking is really cool. Lasts 5 days before it needs a charge. When I wear it, I forget it's on. Bluetooth Sync with my phone, and Sync wirelessly with my computer. Revolutionary product. Cons: The battery charger is flawed and the charger breaks quickly. Replacement chargers are expensive. Snap design is flawed and I had to purchase a BitBelt (great product) to prevent myself from losing it when it fell off frequently. The real problem I ran into was my battery died after a half a year of use. Fitbit stood behind their product and sent me a replacement with no hassle. Then the replacement died after a week of use. Fitbit is sending me a third. I am really impressed that Fitbit is standing behind their product and sending me a third unit. The problem is that the failure rate is just too high. I hope this one lasts but I will certainly have my eye on the Black Friday sales this year as maybe I may get a unit without a rechargeable battery like a Garmin Vivofit for my next tracker. Edit: I took away a star because my second tracker that I received on 8/23 died after 2 days on 8/25. I emailed FitBit for support but at this point I really don't care if they send a replacement. Edit 2: They replaced this tracker with a defective replacement. On 2 battery failures out of 3 charges, they said they were isolated incidents. Now on the third battery failure, they will either send me a replacement or I will contact the Better Business Bureau. I changed this review to 1 star.",

Plus it's a nice little accessory to put on with your outfit for the day, especially for those that don't wear a watch. The only downside to this is the fact that sometimes it doesn't sync with my IPhone app, and I have to delete the app and start over again. It saves all your info, so that isn't a problem, but I have had a couple of sync issues the past few months. The one thing that I wish I had done was to upgrade to the Charge instead, as it does function as a watch as well, but this s a great product, and helps for those that are either looking to lose weight, or just want to jump on the next exercise trendy object.

I've found it to be an interesting diversion, but not really motivating or particularly informative. I did find it interesting that the two \"most active\" days I registered wearing it were days I didn't do any formal exercise. I was in New York, walking many city blocks those days!

            "review_text": "Update 8/12/13 I do not recommend wearing the Flex in shower. Water collects in the resovoir where the Fitbit is lodged. When you remove the Fitbit to clear the water, you run the risk of tearing the bracelet at the point where it connects to the LED display window, which unfortunately I've done. Also, the skin becomes irritated/rash-like at the point where the Fitbit is against the skin. This has seemed to improve since I've stopped wearing it in the shower. Update: 7/26/13 I went walking on a Google Map one-mile, round trip route. The Fitbit Flex recorded the walk accurately. I'm guessing that the issue then when using an elliptical machine, or running in general, may have to do with one's personal stride. I also forgot to mention that the Fitbit Flex does not sync with the HTC One X, despite the Android phone's NFC and Bluetooth capabilities. Hopefully the support for this phone will be added soon. I have had the Fitbit Flex for almost a month now and it's fantastic! It's really a product of the future (I suppose we're there now). I've found it to be a great way to stay informed of one's overall activity and general health. While some aspects of one's health may be beyond their control (genetics), this device allows you to maintain those aspects that are within one's ability to maintain. I love the Fitbit Flex because it's literally a constant reminder on your wrist. The two size bracelets are great with varying adjustment clasps. I generally adjust it tighter for activities such as sports and running, while loosening it slightly for daily use. I've read other reviews and some appear to have had issues with the bracelet, however I think that the design is fantastic. It's adjustable, so you're not stuck with a size that is uncomfortable. I also like the way that the bracelet \"clicks\" when it is secured, this way you're certain not to lose it. I've played beach volley ball, football, and also went into the ocean (accidentally) with the Fitbit Flex and it's still on my wrist! Sometimes, I forget that it's there, as it's so light and unobtrusive. It's become such a part of my routine. The battery life is great (five days) and the sleep tracker provides wonderful insight. The accompanying software, graphs, etc. make it really easy to track one's progress. It's also great that it integrates with third party apps like myfitnesspal.com, which displays calorie intake verses activity. It's a great product for anyone attempting to get into shape. If you're already active, you'll absolutely love this device as it provides in-depth analysis into one's goals. I also purchased the Aria scale, which combined with all of the Fitbit software, just provides greater analysis. In the three weeks that I've had the Fitbit Flex, I've lost five pounds! This goes back to it being a constant reminder on your wrist and my running on days that I normally would have taken off (but I want to reach that distance goal). I have a friend who has a Fitbit One and so we have a friendly step competition, which also helps in staying active. This product would be five stars if I could be certain about it's distance accuracy. I generally run on an elliptical machine, which displays my run as four miles. The Fitbit Flex usually credits me with running 3.5 miles. I am planning walking one mile via a Google Map route from my home, to gauge the Fitbit's accuracy. Overall, a fantastic product!",

Overall, this is great if it motivates you to move more, but if you're looking for something that can accurately tell you how many steps you've taken and how many calories you've burned - don't buy this. I'm really disappointed in the product because I paid almost 100 dollars for junk. Note: I'm aware that no pedometer is accurate, but the Fitbit is HIGHLY inaccurate which defeats the whole purpose of having it in the first place. Those who gave this 5 stars probably doesn't realize that the readings are all wrong. It tells you that you burn thousands of calories and thousands of steps even if you've been sedentary at the office for 10 hours. My advice?

The bands are comfortable and you can get them in any color you desire (for a nominal fee of course). It is water resistant , so if you forget and wear it in the shower, no bigs. It buzzes when you hit your goal and also has a little light show for you. I appreciate the positive reinforcement. You can set a goal higher/lower than the default which is 10,000 steps a day. It has an online community tied to your Facebook friends so you can have a weekly competition if so desired. It sends you e-mails like, \"So far this year, you have walked to the Golden Gate Bridge and Back!\" So, the negatives: I don't like that I don't know how many steps I have left to go to get to my goal. It has 5 lights. For each 2000 steps, the light shines solid (when you tap the bracelet). If you are \"in progress,\" the light will flicker. So, when the 4 lights are solid and the 5th is flickering, you might have 1999 steps left to make your goal, or 2 steps left. You don't know until you upload it. The bracelets are sort of flimsy. I have destroyed 3 so far and I have had this since Christmas (it's August now). Fitbit has sent replacements for free. The sleep function isn't accurate for me. The fitbit doesn't record elliptical steps accurately, but otherwise, from what I can tell, the steps are pretty accurate. The iPhone app is pretty good....you can watch your steps real time if you are worried about accuracy. It also sends you alerts like, \"You're almost there, 1958 steps to go!\" or \"Way to go overachiever, you're 1987 steps above your goal!\"",

I am having to charge it every four days, also not desirable given the lack of time I have had the fitbit. Lastly, the app leaves room for improvement. The syn time with my phone is not very good and I feel I spend entirely to much time waiting for my devices to sync together. I have the Samsung S6 so I have a newer device and I still have to restart my Bluetooth everything I try to look at my daily stats. I look at my stats at least 3 times a day so having to restart my Bluetooth everything is irritating. I do love how it tracks my steps daily and how I can log my food. I also live how it keeps me on track for daily goals.",

So it is comfortable for me to stabilize myself at times. With my arm resting on the treadmill rail the Fitbit simply stopped recording steps. I was walking briskly at 3.2 mph and nothing. I then put it on my ankle using a rubber band contraption and it was almost perfect with the step counts. Unless you are Italian and wave your hands around constantly this thing is WILDLY inaccurate on a treadmill and quite inaccurate walking outdoors. It seems to work fairly well when worn on the ankle. So 3 stars for that and -2 for the idiots that advise against using the thing in a way that actually works.",

I contacted FitBit Customer Support and after submitting all of the proof and evidence (receipt, pictures, etc.) they wrote me back yesterday that they'll replace it but the bands are on back order and they can give me no date as to when I might receive it. So, as this band continues to break apart, moisture gets into the display and fogs it. When it finishes breaking apart, I'll have to carry the device around in my pocket which defeats the whole purpose of spending 100 bucks on the flex version. If I'd wanted to carry it around, I could have bought a much cheaper version. The customer service I received was unacceptable. How do you tell a customer that you have no estimated date on the replacement of a part that is critical to the intended functionality of the whole product? I also felt lied to. I guarantee you that if I purchased a new FitBit, the bands for it wouldn't be on \"back order\". I guarantee you that if I went on their site and coughed up cash for new bands, those wouldn't be on \"back order\" either. They put me on the back burner because they've already got my money.

            "review_text": "I'm not Patty. But, she and I bought two of these, one for each of us. There's a much longer review by someone else that pretty much says it all, but I'll give you my view of it. I've had the flex for a week. It is working to motivate me - for now. Let's see how it goes over time -- after -- the novelty wears off. So, I like the device, but not for the price. Personally, I think it was over-hyped. I'm a techie and expected a bit more than I got. First, you get a USB dongle to sync your device to a computer - that's good. But, since I have Bluetooth on my Android phone, I was expecting to be able to sync with it too. Not the case - that's bad. Sure, there's an app so you can connect to your on-line dashboard, but it doesn't update until you're close to wherever the USB dongle is connected. It would be great if it could sync in real time with my phone and I could get up-to-the-minute updates on the phone I normally carry with me. You really have to pay attention to the \"Syncs automatically with select mobile devices and to your computer\" statement. Look - there are other phones out there than the iPhone. With as many Droids out there already, I'm surprised there isn't an app that works well with the device. Second, Like the other reviewer mentioned, it does not give you how many calories you REALLY burned. I'm sure it makes a good attempt at calculating your burned calories by taking into account your weight, the number of steps you've taken, and so on. But if you do other activities that are not measurable by a pedometer, you're not going to get an accurate burn count. Third, the free fitbit account is usable. For the price I paid for this device, I expected more. You can go premium, and pay the extra $$, but I say: I already paid a premium. Include the reports and everything else premium offers and now you're talking. If nothing else, if it was include for a year or two to get you going, then pay after that, THAT would be a deal. It could be a bit more user friendly. I like the tiles and reorganizing features of the dashboard. More of that on the other pages and it would be much better. Fourth, I like the silent alarm feature. I think this is a cool feature. I hope to make use of the multiple alarm feature as a reminder to be more alert. More on this in a future review. Fifth, as has already been said, it needs more sensors; my addition: for the price. GPS? Heart-rate monitor? Fuse these and other sensors to make a truly smart device that provides more accurate information. Sixth, needs to go open source, or open API(and I don't mean the web APIs already available) so that other, savvy, developers can interface directly with the device and make more, interesting, apps available. I hope to provide an update in about a month to see where I really stand with this device at that time. It's not a bad device. I am using it. I'm currently motivated with it. Time will tell if I'm still using it in a month. Tony.",

The problem with something like this is that it takes extra time to put it on. So, after many months of use he took it for granted that it wouldn't fall off without the Velcro, but of course he then lost it. I'm glad he got some money's worth out if it, but it's a shame that Fitbit doesn't automatically include some sort of safety latch on the Flex model. It's just an additional piece of rubber that slides over the closure to keep it from coming undone. And also, if you buy replacement bands from a different company, some of them come with the \"safety\" rubber piece. Unfortunately his didn't last long enough for me to purchase it.",

            "review_text": "***Updated 8-25-2013*** I took a morning walk today and brought the same 3 devices with me that I used in my first comparison. The results were very different and not so good for the Fitbit Flex. Nike+ = 4.02 miles. New Balance Via Active pedometer 4.11 miles. 9665 steps. Fitbit Flex band 3.69 miles??? 8276 steps??? I tend to think the Nike+ app and the Pedometer are closer to correct since the distances they measured are very close to each other. I have walked the neighborhood before too and think from previous experience that I was right near 4 miles. If that's the case, then why is the Fitbit Flex so low compared to the other two? The Flex battery is fully charged, I just charged it last night. And the numbers are the most recent as I synced the Flex to the computer as soon as I got into the house from the walk. What's more confusing is that originally, I was finding that on a daily basis, the Flex was giving me more steps then I normally took. It still does. So this morning's result is pretty shocking. I definitely have to change my thinking that the Fitbit Flex is to be used more to give you a VERY GENERAL idea of how much you have done and not trusted to give an accurate accounting. Addressing something I said in the original review, Fitbit did send me an XL sized band when I requested it. I did wear the Flex on my left arm (non-dominant) next to my watch for a few days, I did not find any appreciable change in the readings the Flex was giving me. So I am back to wearing it on my right arm (dominant) for comforts sake. On the plus side, syncing with the phone and the computer still works mostly flawlessly, though sometimes I cannot sync to the computer because apparently, the Fitbit dongle doesn't always get detected by the computer again when it wakes up from sleep mode. The Fitbit Connect software will tell me the dongle cannot be found. This generally won't correct itself until I reboot the computer. For the accuracy issues, I am taking away a star from my rating and giving it 3 stars. ***Original Review*** The reason for writing this was to give an idea of the accuracy of the Fitbit Flex. I took my first walk this morning wearing the Flex. For comparison, I also wore an old style digital pedometer and I also had the Nike + app running on my phone. Here are the results after a little more then 3 mile walk. Nike+ 3.41 miles. 428 calories New Balance Via Active pedometer 3.37 miles. 1346 calories 7677 steps Fitbit Flex band 3.43 miles 1378 calories 7527 steps Overall, not too bad. Considering the Nike+ app is using Gps to calculate distance but the other two devices are just using motion sensors, all the results are fairly close. The reason the calorie count for the Nike is so much lower is that it's only showing calories for the amount of distance traveled. The Fitbit and the pedometer are, I believe, giving what they consider a Total calorie count the body has burned so far in the day since midnight, both from the walk and just by being alive. So in this case, I have to give the Fitbit Flex good marks. BUT, and there is always a but, I do think that when just going about your everyday stuff, the Flex is a little too sensitive. I remember the average step count the old Fitbit Ultra used to give me after a day of work and the Fitbit Flex is consistantly 1000 steps or more higher for a day. I have also tested it myself, downloading the data now, and then downloading again say 15 to 30 minutes later when I have just been sitting at the computer or after just moving the steering wheel while driving. And sure enough, the step count will have gone up some. I am sure it's picking up just the random motion of the arm while typing, moving the mouse around or just doing other random stuff and counting it as steps. Fitbit even says on its website that: \"Flex is a motion sensor on your wrist. There are many instances where your hands may be moving, but your body may not be, such as playing the drums, cooking, or even burping a baby. Flex may count some extra steps here and there to give you credit when it thinks you are active.\" So if you need something that's dead on accurate for a whole day of activity, this may not be the best thing for it. But for actually walking/running, the Fitbit Flex seems to have done a pretty good job. Additionally, I find the Flex mostly comfortable to wear and you forget it's there. I currently wear the Flex on my dominant hand because I have a watch on the non-dominant hand. Fitbit does suggest wearing the band on the non-dominant hand. Maybe once I get the XL band, I can wear the Flex next to my watch on the other arm (it won't fit higher on that arm now) and the accuracy might improve. I have the Fitbit Connect software on my computer and have the Fitbit app on my Galaxy S3 phone. Syncing works flawlessly with both of them.",

I'm so frustrated with my Fitbit Flex. I love the idea of the product, and when it's working I like having it. I've owned it for three months now, and it's stopped syncing and charging. For a while I could mess with the dongle and get it to charge, but now, not even that works. It won't sync to the Fitbit software on my computer or the app on my phone. I did every step recommended on the troubleshoot website, and no results. I've contacted Fitbit twice and have gotten no response. I can't in good conscience recommend the product, because of the product itself as well as the customer service. I bought this because I heard the customer service was great. That does not seem to be the case on my end. I wanted to love this item, but if I can't get it replaced or something, I will have to lower the review to even just one start. Seems to me that a lot of people have issues with their Fitbit Flex around the 3 month mark. Why keep selling them if you know they are a faulty product? Very disappointed. **Update: I found a phone number to finally contact via a live person. They seemed very helpful on the phone. I am hoping to receive my replacement soon.",

I find the step tracker to be really accurate and agree with everyone that says it's one of the best on the market. The band is really easy to wear, I never find it cumbersome or heavy. I use it on my left hand underneath my watch and it's just perfect. One of my favorite features is the silent alarm, I'm quite obsessed with it actually. It's a light vibration that you really cannot ignore. The battery lasts for 4-5 days and charges very quickly, 1 or 2 hours.

My bad, I was breathing, of course it would pop off. If they fixed this, I'd give it 3 stars. If they fixed the buggy software, I'd give it 4.5 stars. I must also mention that I had to get a replacement since there was an issue with the battery. It just stopped charging. FitBit just needs to get thier act together and improve these core things about the device. The fact that they can't manage to make a functional band should be enough to stay away from the flex for now...if you can. On a positive note, I loved the fact that I could sync it with my Virgin Pulse account. I also loved the idea of it, just throw it on and forget it. I never took it off. You could get it wet and not even worry about it. Again the biggest problem was it took itself off....twice!!! Like a dummy, I will again pony up the $100 to get another one. I need the flex to track my steps per day for Virgin Pulse. Ironically I will use the $100 I get quarterly from Virgin Pulse to buy it. I did notice that there are now locking mechanisms (not by fitbit) that you can purchase to hold the clasp on. For anyone who is considering this device, purchase that lock!",

            "review_text": "What a disappointing product! After two weeks of using it, I keep disliking it very much. These are the problems I see with this product: a) It is overpriced for what it gives you. Every time I want to see my progress I need to log in online because the iphone app does not sync if the device is not synced first with the online application. I would have preferred to be able to tap on my wrist and see how many steps I've walked without the need to sync anywhere. It is very inconvenient. For $99 this device should have this feature b) If you are over 55 years of age and have some arthritis, you'll have problems putting this on your wrist. I do not have problems with my hands, but it has been cumbersome to put it on. c) it does not come with any instructions on how to use it. One has to create an account to log in to fitbit.com. Again, inconvenient! One has to search the fitbit.com to learn how to use it. A few instructions inside the package it comes with would have been much better!. d) the online dashboard is not reliable. I think when the battery is low, the device syncs wrong information to fitbit.com. Last night all my progress was wrong. It indicated that for the last week I walked the same number of steps daily, which it is incorrect. Today it shows that I have walked 0 steps for the whole week. Summarizing: If you love to be connected to your computer or your phone, then maybe this device if for you. Otherwise, find something else.",

            "review_text": "Ok, so I bought the FitBit Flex as well as the Jawbone UP 24, and I wore them together for a couple days. I ended up returning the FitBit Flex. Here's what I have to say. - Both the FitBit Flex and the Jawbone fit comfortably, though the Jawbone is less pliable than the bit bit. The Flex stayed in place, since you could tighten it, the Jawbone slide around some, but not enough to hate it. - They both seem to accurately determine step counts. I did like that the Flex allowed you to tap it to see your progress throughout the day - something that the Jawbone lacks. - They are both easy to put into sleep mode, either by the app on your phone or by tapping multiple times (Flex) or holding in a button (Jawbone). - Overall, they are both quality products. The Jawbone, in my opinion, is more stylish than the Flex, but the Flex isn't awful to look at. - So, all things considered...it came down to the app. The Jawbone app was more visually appealing and had more features than the Flex (power nap, reminders, Smart Alarm, and Idle Alert). The Flex gave you a better track on your daily goals. They both do well with integrating into MyFitnessPal, but the Flex gives you a better representation of how you are doing with calories in vs. out, your goal weight, and your water intake...all things the Jawbone app lacks. The visual appearance and overall feature of the reminders and idle alerts are what got me to like Jawbone more. In either case, you're getting a good product. And - I'm sure FitBit will eventually add more features and make their app \"prettier\". I did notice one more thing that sealed the deal...the FitBit offers an advanced package on their website, but that would cost you an additional $50/year, which add a little more function, but really should all be included in the free version. There you have it - my review. Enjoy!",

            "review_text": "It's just okay.. and here's why I dont really like this thing and it is mostly related to the software to actually use this thing. 1. You MUST be online to sync it and review your stats. This is a huge flaw. I was out hiking for a week or so and lost a couple of days activity because I couldn't sync.There are still places in this world (thank god) where you cant get a cell phone signal let alone a wireless connection for you tablet, phone or what ever you are using to track with. 2. You can only make one sleep entry and you can not edit a sleep event. Once you set a sleep log you cant go back and modify it or change it in any way. Occasionally I have to get up in the middle of the night to work on international projects. I may get up and 2 and go back to bed at 4. It does not allow you to do this. 3. The calories burned and the database that FitBit provides is lame. You can only keep about 20 items on the usual list and you have to search the database for other foods. It is EXTREMELY limited and a pain in the ass to keep track of custom foods you might add. Seems that their software, which is key to using this device, is pretty immature and needs significant additional development to make it work well. They tout that it will count levels (floors if you will) that you walk. I take the stairs up 8 flights every day and it never shows any of that activity. Also if your on an exercise machine where the sensor cant tell your moving (like a stationary bike) it does not track your activity accurately. Don't waste your money on this one... keep looking! I'm going to try the Samsung band next as this one has left me wanting for sure!",

Water tight operation is an added bonus that we've relied on and tested too so bath , shower , swim and dive with some peace of mind . Also this more basic model doesn't do everything some of it's peers does but it does plenty and enough and it's so light and simple you ll almost forget it's even on . lastly , you can expect about a 2.5/3 day life cycle from a single charge which i couldn't seem to find any info on before buying so hopefully that helps someone else out there as well .",

            "review_text": "We are up to our third fitbit. The first one disappeared out of it's holster so we cautiously bought a second. The fitbit is a fine piece of hardware though the battery technology must be two generations old--we really should be able to get a week or more on a single charge. Probably the best benefit is that it makes you focus on fitness--what you eat and how much you move. The iOS app is average--clearly not a highlight of the fitbit and the iPad version is just a double-sized iPhone app. It's nice that you can sync up via Bluetooth to get instant readouts but that doesn't make up for the poor user interface and the difficulty in finding things in the app. If someone comes along with a comparable fitness monitor but a good iOS app, I'll be making a change immediately because the real value of the fitbit is in the information that you get out of it, and the app is a key interface. The sleep monitor function is the most frustrating part of the fitbit. Its never clear whether the fitbit is in sleep mode or that you've woken it up in the morning. When it works, it works fine. But more than half the time I end up with either 16 hours of sleep (with 9 hours of awake or restlessness) or 0 hours of sleep. It's inconceivable why they can't use the LED lights to provide a more intuitive display for the sleep mode. I recommend the fitbit as a good tool for losing weight and staying fit, and avoiding the sedentary lifestyle that an office job produces. As I said, we liked it enough to buy a third one and that's because they are the best player in the game. However, once someone nails the iOS software side of fitness trackers, you'll see a real category killer and that will be the new recommendation.",

When I lost my Fitbit Zip, I chose this because I wanted a Fitbit that I wouldn't lose and I thought that the wrist model would be more secure. Although it is more secure on my wrist, it does NOT display the actual steps that you are taking on it. You have to either sync to your computer or if you have a 5th generation iPod or iPhone, you can download an APP and sync to it. Unfortunately for me, I have a 4th generation iPod so the Flex will only sync to my computer. What I liked about the Zip is that at any given moment, I would just have to tap it and it would tell me my steps which would encourage me to walk more. Now, I have to be on my computer to know my exact steps. The Fitbit will flash lights to let you know roughly were you are in your goals, but that's it. It is automatically set up with the goal of 10,000 steps (which you could change) so 1 light out of 5 means that you've completed 20% of your goal (2000 steps). So for those who do not have the latest technology (iPhone, iPod), stick with the Zip.",

I would wake up feeling tired. But my Fitbit tells me otherwise, I now know that I fall asleep within 5 - 10 minutes and even though I am restless during the night, my sleep efficiency is 93-97%. Knowing this has given me the energy boost that I need in the morning because I really am sleeping well, I just had a preconceived notion that I did not sleep well. The other thing I really like it the ease of tracking my food intake for the day. I have always hated doing that, it is such a pain!

            "review_text": "There's a lot I wish the flex had that it does not, but maybe in the future... My favorite and main reason I bought this is the sleep tracker. To turn on you open your app and basically turn on sleep mode. From that point on the flex tracks your sleep through movement and records your sleep time, restlessness and awake time by the minute. When you wake to start to your day you open the app and turn sleep mode off. It then creates a graph that visual measures your sleep time and shows you in minutes by colors the times you sleep soundly, we're restless or awake. If you wake during the night and walk around or get a snack you still leave your flex on sleep mode. This way you can have a better representation of your sleep patterns. From the website I was able to print off daily and weekly sleep charts to share with my doctors to try to improve my sleeping habits. I enjoyed seeing the number of steps i was taking each time I would sync my flex and how many miles I walked each day. I found myself walking more to see if I could beat the previous days total or to round off miles for the day . The flex also gives you a estimate of how many calories you burn as we'll. You can enter additional activities in the log such as exercising or mowing the grass to make the estimated calories burned more accurate. You can also add food to a log to keep a caloric count of you day. If your exact food does not appear on the preselected list you can manual add everything. A lot of common fast food is already on the list. The battery lasts for about four to five days but charges quickly. The downside is there is no heart rate or blood pressure monitor and you must manual turn your flex to sleep mode. But the band is decently comfortable and does not irritate my sensitive skin. It's also water resistant, easy to clean and looks like a simple wrist band. I love the graphs and data the flex collects I just wish it did more!",

I sometimes have to restart the app (on my iPhone) multiple times before it actually syncs up with it. It'll say it's looking for it the entire time and nothing ever happens. Also it says you've burned calories even when it doesn't know the amount of walking/activity you've done. You can turn this off (I think) but I'm confused how it would know how much you've actually burned. I do love the sleep tracker. Mine has been very accurate and I'm thankful that I have it for that reason. It does count steps and let you know how many miles you've walked throughout the day so thats great. It takes about 3 hours to fully charge and the charges lasts about 5 days. You have to charge it with your computer (or other usb). I probably wouldn't buy this particular one again.",

Since I became slightly more serious about working out, I've been disappointed. The most difficult aspect is the accuracy of the steps/distance. Make sure that you nail your stride perfectly when you enter it into your fitbit profile on the website. Even then, their stated accuracy is 90%--WHICH I ABSOLUTELY CAN LIVE WITH--except I'm not seeing that kind of accuracy. All I want to see is the level of accuracy that they sold me on. After I questioned the functionality of my first fitbit and took the step test, they happily replaced it and the experience was very professional. I'm on my 2nd fitbit and it isn't much better. Lets look at the math (which I've reviewed with numerous reps at fitbit): 1 mile = 5280 feet. My pace is 2.25 feet per \"step\". This means that my fitbit should record roughly 2,346 \"steps\" per mile (5280/2.25). So my 3.5 mile workout should yield roughly 7,350 \"steps\" (5280*3.5=18,480; 18,480/2.25= 8,213 @ 90% =7,392) yet I'm always recording somewhere in the neighborhood of 6,500 steps. Today it recorded 6,142 steps and 2.92 miles for a 3.5 mile jaunt. I'm not doing any serious training so I've just accepted the gross inaccuracy and eventually I quit bothering fitbit customer service. I must say that they are very patient in customer service, although they don't always seem to be able to track customer history. If you don't mind purchasing an activity tracker that doesn't accurately measure your activity, I'm sure that you will enjoy the fitbit.",

And this is with a stable wifi connection so the fault is definitely with the product. To add to that, the actually bracelet actually tore into two parts after wearing for only 2 months. This was definitely a design flaw since it tore at a point right where the actually tracking mechanism is entered into the bracelet. A little picky here, but the device also does a terrible job at picking up activity outside of running/walking such as lifting, push ups, or ab exercises. It basically treats these activities as non-activity. Altogether I'd say I've had a terrible experience with this product. Don't buy!",

So I exchanged it for free from Amazon with no problems. I'm finding it just motivates me to get off my butt and walk more. I get excited to see how many steps I can walk and badges I can earn. I also like competing with my friends to see who is getting the most steps in. Today I finally got first place for the first time! Woo Hoo! But I like the motivation. I made myself get up and walk around the block a couple times before work today, and I make myself get up and walk around the office and even outside multiple times per day. In the beginning I was finding that 10,000 steps was kind of hard and there were days I wasn't getting 10,000 in. But just 3 weeks later I have it set to 15,000 steps a day because 10,000 became easy! So now I'm trying to get 15,000/day in!!! I'm not losing a ton of weight but that's because I'm not necessarily eating perfectly. I need to work on that. I have days that I do well but then the weekend comes and I don't do well... but even without the perfect eating I'm still down about 2.5 pounds in the 3 weeks because of just the moving moving moving all the time. I did not take it with me one day when I went to the water park. I have seen mixed reviews on swimming, some people say they've taken it swimming many times with no issues and some say they've gone swimming and it died. So I just don't want to risk it.

Just touch them together and the app opens and syncs data. 3. The software itself is useful and easy. 4. Sleep monitor works great. It is very nice to know how many times I woke up during the night and how long I slept. 5. Vibrating alarm clock feature is AWESOME. I simply set my alarms on the computer (or phone), sync and go! No more forgetting to set my alarm. No more waking up my wife. My arm vibrates and I wake up. Nice!! So now we get to the learning curve part. Certain activities will trick the band fitbit into thinking you are exercising/walking when you are not. I ride a motorcycle (chopper). The fit bit mistook the vibration for thousands of steps. It also went in and out of sleep mode because it thought I was tapping it. When I mowed the grass, the fitbit registered thousands of steps again. So I am learning that there are times when I must take it off and put it in my pocket and then put it back on when I am finished. This is the only \"problem\" that I have found so far. I would purchase another and I have recommended it to several friends. I will update my review in a few weeks to let you know if there is anything else that I have found.",

That's worth two extra stars in my book. However, it doesn't change the fact that my original unit, at least, lasted just over one year. If others find the same problem there may be quality-control issues. Also, I find syncing my Flex to my iPhone erratic. For a while some days did not display properly; recently it takes two or three tries to connect to the phone. However, those concerns aside I do like the unit and its features. It motivates me to focus on better exercise and gives me useful information on my activity and sleep.",

Due to their horrible $30 pedometer which broke every three or four months, and which you had to pay out of pocket to replace, I stopped doing the program. Then I noticed a couple people around work with the flex, and they liked it, so I got one It is compatible with Virgin's program. I really like wearing it on the wrist, since it registers more activity than wearing a regular pedometer. I paddle a lot (canoe and kayak),plus mountain bike, and it registers activity with these, as well as swimming, so I don't have to log them separately on the website to at least get some credit (since I never logged activities anyway). Now the bad part. The stupid band! It breaks more often than my old pedometer, and if you buy bands from Fitbit, they cost about the same. Luckily, there are plenty of the $10 knock-offs that are comparable to the OEM. But if you are not careful with the band, you will be buying one every month or two. Perhaps the price on the bands will evenutally drop to $2 each and won't be as much of a burden in the future. The next bad part is the stupid charging method, which probably causes the majority of broken bands. You have to pop the unit out of the band and put it in a USB charging cradle. if you press on the wrong end of the band to pop out the module, it is likely to break the band. Why in the world couldn't they use a standard microUSB port instead, where you don't have to remove the module from the and, which would also alleviate the problem of not having a stupid cradle around when you need to charge it. I do realize that they would need a port cover to prevent water entry, but this would be a LOT easier to deal with than taking the module off the band.",

            "review_text": "I got a Fitbit Ultra in August 2012 and loved being able to track my steps, sleeps and floor in the same place as my weight and food. I'm a definitely a nerd and this appealed to me. I loved the Ultra and over the next year to year and a half, I probably missed wearing it only a handful of days. Then it pulled a vanishing act between my apartment and the bus stop. After failing to find it, I ordered the Flex. The pluses (compared to the Ultra or the One or Zip): I like that the Flex has a wrist band --- it isn't going to pull a vanishing act like my Ultra did, or at the very least I would hopefully notice sooner. I had problems with the wrist band for sleep tracking coming undone during the night and the Velcro losing its stick over time with the Ultra. It is easier to keep on as I wear it on my wrist and it is waterproof. When I forgot to wear the Ultra, it was almost always because I forgot it put it back on after a shower or in the morning rushing out the door. Cons: It doesn't track stairs. I was really disappointed when I got it and found that out as I really liked the stairs metric and badges. It doesn't have a useful display. You get 1-5 lights on the display instead of a readout like the other models. I think this was simply due to the small size of the Flex compared to the other models as the Force (now discontinued) shows the data. It doesn't matter much for me, I normally would look at the data online, but having something on my wrist and not being able to get the time out of it is frustrating at times. But this is a really small \"frustration.\" It is less \"discrete\" than the One/Ultra/Zip. It doesn't look bad but it is out-of-place with more formal outfits. The One/Ultra/Zip could be discretely tucked into the pocket or a bra strap and be nearly entirely invisible. If you are willing to pay the little extra, the Flex makes a great tracker for a forgetful person. It is also a good tracker for the \"loss adverse\" (like I was after losing my Ultra). Depending on your lifestyle, needs and memory, the One/Zip-style trackers may be better choices.",

            "review_text": "I love this thing. I bought it because I thought it would be useful to count steps - I had about 15 pounds to lose and wanted to make sure I was getting consistent exercise. Turns out that for me, the real benefit is keeping track of calories in vs. out. I really had no idea that I was overeating so much (like an extra 800-1000 calories on some days). It takes a fair amount of work that the Fitbit does NOT do to get good estimates of caloric intake, especially since we eat very little packaged food. But taking the time to calculate how much a meal preparation has (in terms of calories) is an eye opener. It also showed me that my biggest problem was portion control, and 'seconds'. I typically drank very little water, but now I routinely hit 2500ml (85oz) a day. The step counter is motivational, as you want to hit that goal every day. The ability to check your progress without the smartphone interface is cool too. The software is easy to use and customizable, so you can look at all of the available data or just the things most important to you. There's a lot of caloric data in the database, but I frequently build custom foods using online databases of ingredients. The band is comfortable and has a good adjustment range. The clasp takes a little getting used to, but is not poorly designed, it's just different. Bottom line - Fitbit helped me realize how much I was overeating, motivates me to hit my steps/water/exercise activity goals, and I'm down 8# in 3 weeks:182 to 174. (I average about an 600 calorie deficit on weekend days and about 1000 on weekdays). I don't expect the last 8 pounds to go this well, but I never would have guessed this device could help so much. Excellent purchase for me.",

First and foremost, you open the packaging upon arrival and there is practically no information about the thing. Just the web address for the fitbit, the website walks you through installation and all that, but I have still not been able to find a concise list or chart or SOMETHING about what all these damn lights mean. You just learn as you go, which personally drives me crazy. Apparently, you are supposed to receive an email and/or warning when your battery gets low... well, I did a 5k and was so excited to see how many steps I logged when I checked my phone, only to find that it was dead and hadn't logged a thing. Thats happened to me twice now.... have yet to see an email or battery life actually be correct on my phone. It always says 1/2 full even when it's dead and charging on my laptop. I don't think the steps are accurate. This morning it said I walked 43 steps, when all I did was walk from the bedroom to the kitchen to get coffee....if my house were that big I wouldnt care enough about the 100$ and whatever dollars I spent to buy this thing to write a review about it! I have a small wrist. Using the small wristband, it fits well. Advertising says you can wear it in the shower, but I don't. I find that it is hard to put on. The first time took me about 15 minutes because it was all so stiff. Easier now, but still aggravating at times when the little teeth-like things won't snap in. I Crossfit, and get pretty sweaty. I now have a sore on my wrist from the friction of the fitbit when I sweat. Had to stop wearing it for a few days till that subsided, only to get another one the next time I wore it Crossfitting. Have already had to do a reset once; you don't lose any information or anything, but I feel like a product that is only 6 weeks old should not have to be reset so soon. All in all, I'm pretty dissapointed....Hmmm,,, maybe this review should be two stars...",

I have had a zip for two years and was getting tired of having to swap it every time I changed clothes (or forgetting to swap it) and having to have pants with pockets for me to comfortably wear it (it never stayed in my waistband). With the Flex it's on my wrist all the time, no matter what I'm wearing. It doesn't accidentally get washed and only gets taken off to shower, swim or charge the battery. I thought I wasn't going to like the dot display rather than the actual step numbers, but I've found that the dots are actually very intuitive and probably do a better job of keeping me motivated to keep going until all my dots are lit up to meet my step goal. Plus I can easily sync it to my phone (Samsung Note 3) and my tablet (Samsung Note 2014) via Bluetooth or by PC via bluetooth dongle that comes with it. It was also nice that this comes with the large and small bands so you can custom fit it to any size. I like that it is charged via a USB port rather than using a watch battery that dies about every 6 months. With the Flex I just pop in in the charger while I'm in the shower a couple times a week and I'm good to go. It hold a charge for about a week before needing a recharge, depending on how often you sync it. Very well worth it and a great product. I always loved my Zip, but I really love my Flex!",

It does pick up the active minutes though. You can sync your Fitbit account with your My Fitness Pal account, so if you log the elliptical time in MFP it will show up as excercise on your Fitbit account, but it still won't change the steps. 2. Falls off ALL THE TIME. It's honestly a miracle I haven't lost it because I don't always feel it when it falls of my wrist (kind strangers usually give me a heads up if I don't notice it fall). My husband's Charge never falls off though and it has the same kind of clasp, so I don't know, maybe I'm just rough with it. Those points aside, I love the Fitbit! It's worth the quirks.",

Sure enough, when I started tracking what I was doing, it did not look all that impressive- about 8,000 steps a day. I started pushing myself to 10K steps a day. Then I discovered the groups on the FitBit online platform- either city-based or interest-based, I joined a few and started competing with them. Before you know it, I was doing anywhere from 10K to 18-20K daily. On certain superactive days, such as shore boardwalk days, hikes etc I would get 30K+. Fun. Without focusing on any weight change, I lost about 12-13 lbs, without eating any differently, just from the increased exercise.I like the battery time of about 5 days and the fact that it's water resistant. I did not use the sleep tracking capabilities, as I sleep like a log most nights. The bad: poor quality. It breaks down without me doing anything to it. As of today, Jan 2015, I am on my 3rd FitBit in less than 1 year.The customer service always sent me the free replacement. The dialogue with them is rather slow, it takes them 2 days to respond to any kind of message.In case your are competing in any group, or doing a challenge, having the FitBit crash is a major inconvenience and a total downer. Your numbers will not be right and now you have to wait for the new month to compete again. To end on a positive note, it made a great impact on my fitness level and my health. I wish the product would stop breaking down.Apparently there is no perfect product out there to do the job.So, good luck to you, maybe yours will be from a better batch.",

I've found that knowing how many steps I've taken in a day is a useful motivator if I'm being sedentary for some reason and am lagging behind my \"goal\" of 10,000 a day. In terms of usability, the Fitbit is great. It is small, lightweight, and unobtrusive. It's comfortable to wear. Initially I had some misgivings about the lack of information that the device itself can display. The Nike FuelBand, for instance, can display steps taken and other metrics on the band itself. With Fitbit, this information is mostly displayed in the App or on the dashboard. Since everyone has a smartphone these days, this really does not turn out to be a significant limitation. After a few days I learned to just let the Fitbit count my activity and I check up on it in the app when I want. The device has 5 LEDs that show progress toward 10,000 steps (each one represents 2,000 steps), and it turns out that's all the information you really need. The step counting appears fairly accurate. There is an option to set the sensitivity of the Fitbit based on whether you're wearing it on your dominant hand, the theory being that you use your dominant hand more, so if you're wearing the Fitbit on that hand, it should be less sensitive. I wear mine on my non-dominant hand but have the dominant hand setting selected because I felt otherwise the Fitbit was overcounting my steps. The calorie and distance estimations seem undercounted to me, but those aren't why you really would use this type of device. The most disappointing thing about the Fitbit to me is the sleep tracking function. It doesn't seem particularly accurate. Fitbit thinks I am pretty sound sleeper, but there are nights where I've slept terribly and the Fitbit doesn't seem to pick up on it. The sleep tracking display is also very binary (trinary?) - either you're \"asleep,\" \"awake,\" or \"restless\" - but other sleep measurement devices are better at detecting both these states and the varying gradations between them. Anyway, I love the Fitbit for what it does well, and hope that with software updates they can hone it further to do other stuff better!",

I also love the ability to track my sleep. I've managed to increase my sleep as well, and figure out why I'm so grumpy some mornings (i.e. I woke up 24 times the night before or got 5 hours of sleep.) Sometimes it is difficult to remember to set the sleep mode though. I do have 2 complaints about it though. The wristband is terrible quality. I'm not a very adventurous person. I work at a desk 40-hours a week. Not a week after I had it, the wristband started looking worn and is no longer black, but a grey that won't come clean. The smooth texture actually started becoming a bit rough like something was eating away at it. Adding to that, yes this is safe to wear in the shower, BUT the wristband does collect water, so you should probably remove the tracker every once in a while to dry out the inside of the band. My other complaint is that the method of tapping to interact with the band to either put it in sleep mode or turn off an alarm isn't so great. Fitbit says to tap twice to acknowledge an alarm, or 5 times to start/stop sleep mode, but I usually find myself tapping repeatedly until it does something. With that being said, those two complaints do make me not like the device as much as I wanted to, but with all the other insight it's given me as to my activity, I still choose to wear it every day.

It syncs with your phone automatically It allows you to keep track of your sleep You can join challenges with your friends to help keep you motivated, I love this feature. Cons: It doesn't show your steps on the band, not a problem for me but I can see that being important to some It doesn't track your sleep automatically.

This last time, however, it fell off during a shopping trip to Target (extremely strenuous, I know) and is no where to be found.

I'm not sure what other things I'm missing, because there is no simple manual. You can only find out how to use features you already know exist. I still haven't figured out how to change my daily step goal. I have been all over the web site and the Android app, but there is nowhere to change the value. The software and help are all flash, no function. As to the device, it is good enough. Long battery life, not extremely accurate, but good enough for round numbers. I just warn you to not use a chainsaw or similar tools while wearing it, otherwise you'll put it the Flex into sleep mode (that doesn't mean you'll put it to sleep, it means you'll put it in the mode to monitor your sleep). EDIT / UPDATE: I've returned the device and replaced it with a Flex One ($10 cheaper, too) Fitbit One Wireless Activity Plus Sleep Tracker, Black . I realized if I was carrying anything with the hand the Flex was on, it counted way fewer steps than I was taking. Also, I was having to take it off every time I fired up the chainsaw or weed-whacker, and I'd often forget to put it back on agains. After much testing, it was being very inaccurate (on the low side). When I got the FitBit One, I ran them in parallel for a day, and the One was way more accurate. Also, I was having issue with the lack of display on the Flex. It turns out that I like to see how many steps I've taken, and not just blinking lights. It might just be me, but the Flex's display (or lack thereof) left me cold. The One actually has the numbers on the display, which I like a lot more. Also, I stopped wearing my watch because I didn't like wearing two things on one wrist. Watches aren't as popular anymore, so this might not be a big deal; but I missed my watch.",

I've already followed Fitbit Support's suggestions of cleaning the contacts, etc. I even removed the daily alarm I had set (although with the alarm I still used to be able to go days without charging the Flex). ------------------------ I switched to this from the old (now discontinued) Fitbit Ultra. The Ultra was great because it could display the time, steps, calories, etc. on the actual device, but the Ultra didn't sync directly with mobile devices so you would have to dock it when you wanted to sync. It was also easy to lose since it clipped to clothing (I know several people who have lost them - some more than once!). The band on the Fitbit Flex is really comfortable. Both the small and large bands fit me, but I went with the large because I like to wear it pretty loose. I have been wearing it now for over 6 days and it still shows the battery level at \"medium\", so I am impressed with the battery life. I LOVE the silent alarm. It is SO much better than being awakened by a jolting sound. It is nice to be able to sync wirelessly with my iOS devices and Android phone and always be able to see my current stats. I also love that MyFitnessPal and some other similar apps can access FitBit data. I log my calories with MyFitnessPal, and now the FitBit app will also update to show that information (and MyFitnessPal will adjust my daily calorie budget based on FitBit steps). I really wish it had a clock display so that I wouldn't need to wear my watch. Also, I am suspicious that because of where it is worn (on the wrist) the step count can be pretty inflated depending on what activities you are doing. The other day I was working on some projects in my yard and really wasn't walking all that much (but I was moving my arms quite a bit), but at the end of the day it showed that I had done over 11,000 steps that day. However, this doesn't bother me much because I'm not all that interested in counting exact steps and I figure doing any activities where you are moving burns some calories. For those who are picky it might be an issue, though. One of these days I'm going to remember to wear my old Fitbit Ultra along with the Flex for a full day and compare the step counts. One other gripe - the Flex often goes into Sleep mode during the day. I assume this happens because I accidentally bump it a few times while working on projects around the house, but it has happened quite a few times. The good news is that you can easily bring it out of Sleep mode by tapping for a few seconds. And if you see extra sleep times logged you can delete them pretty easily from the app.",

I'm just watching steps and seeing how inactive I really am. I was curious about my sleep habits and I'm currently enjoying a vibrating alarm to wake me so I thought the Flex would be a great thing to get. It tracks movement while you sleep to help you understand if you're sleep is restful or not, and it gives a buzz at whatever time you set to wake you up. Great! I invested. First I want to say I really, really miss the stinking little face sticking it's tongue out at me. There is no display on the flex to show you anything. You have to go to your phone to see what it tracked. I thought it would get me back in the habit of wearing my watch since I miss that, but it really hasn't. I apparently sleep pretty good, so the shine has worn off the sleep tracking already and it's only been 4 days. I felt the buzz the first morning. I've missed it every morning since so I can't rely on this thing to wake me. It's an unobtrusive double buzz that repeats only once. If you miss it, you over sleep. That's not an alarm unless you're a light sleeper, which I am not by any stretch. I need an alarm I have to react to to shut off. This one isn't an alarm, it's a reminder. The app on my phone is nice. Wish it did monitor my heart rate, but I'm liking being able to sync the device without having to start up my computer. Still, I've been wearing the Zip for months at a time without syncing and not having any issue with it. I was only paying attention to the number of steps. I'm not wearing this to lose weight, just track activity. I sit for a living. I need to move. But I digress. I'm looking at the sleep tracking and the steps on my phone. Having the others in my face might make me pay more attention to them, but I'm still mainly just looking at steps. Still, it's nice to be using more on the app than the Zip tracks. In conclusion, if you're looking at the Fitbit line for more than just getting active, the Flex may be the gadget for you. It seems pretty accurate with the sleep tracking and has another setting to make it more sensitive if you go to the actual site to set it. It does track movement for steps, not actual steps. But it seems fairly accurate there too. It will show you if you've been active at least. But it's not a huge step from the Zip. The sleep mode, vibrating alarm, and missing display are really the only differences. That and how you wear it. I may be going back to my Zip.",

If you are clapping it counts those claps as steps. (I just did this, sitting in a chair and clapping.... granted you have to clap with some enthusiasm...it went from 11,860 to 11,871...I did not move from the chair!) If you are conducting an orchestra it will count your arm movements, as steps, Yes, it does count your arm moving when you are walking or running but most of your arm movements are counted as steps. So...there is no way in the world that it is accurate. I'm debating whether or not to return it. I think it helps me be more active and more aware of my activity (or lack there of), which is good.

I have to plug it in and remove it to get it to function properly again. Not only that, but for the hours that it is not responsive, it doesn't not capture data, therefore useless. - I've tried the sleep mode by tapping several times on the band, and it worked, however when I woke up in the morning and took it off the sleep mode, it didn't capture any data. - I've tried to set the silent alarm twice. It didn't go off either time. - Day 4 and my band is already splitting.

Saw 4 months and 16 excess pounds go by. Have always spent 30 minutes every morning on a treadmill. Stunning lesson for me, using these products, was how inadequate that was: how sedentary the rest of the day was sitting in meetings, sitting in cars, sitting in airports or airplanes. Led to major changes in behavior: e.g., instead of listlessly sitting, looking at my iPhone while waiting to catch a plane, I now get in miles walking concourses while waiting. (Hope TSA does not haul in this person peculiarly doing laps around the waiting area.) Personality matters. The Fitbit approach was well suited to me. One of the few potentially healthy benefits of being a totally type A personality is: give me a goal and I am not going to meet it, I am going to annihilate it. Flex fits my style perfectly. Different personality? Your mileage may vary. Four stars instead of five because Flex pops off my wrist as often as once a day, particularly when taking off a coat or some such. Did lose one and had to buy a replacement. Synching works flawlessly for all the products; web site dashboard is well designed and integration with MyFitnessPal is well done. Moved on to Force reasoning it's bigger band/clasp more likely to stay on. (And more noticeable if beginning to come off.) Quite true. Much prefer it to the Flex because I can get complete feedback (not just blinking lights) at the push of a button. Battery lasts for two weeks which means one less cable I have to haul along on road trips. Stair counting also has me avoiding elevators and escalators. (Back to wanting to annihilate my \"floors climbed\" goal.) Force has been recalled, of course, because of skin irritation for some. Fitbit's taking immediate and complete responsibility here is admirable and another reason to consider their products. After a month, had a bit of itching with my Force. Figured it was salt/oil buildup from heavy daily exercise I do and then let it dry on my wet wrist. Now, just clean band after exercise with a damp tissue and no problem. Although not now available, I mention it because no competitor product I have seen has the same combination of features so I am holding out for what I hope will be a replacement product that Fitbit will bring out (or competitor's comparable product).",

I have found that I can't argue with the lack of little dots on my Fitbit near the end of the day.

Although I didn't buy for weight loss but rather for general fitness the log for food/calories and weight works. I have lost almost 5 pounds in 3 weeks by keeping track of calories in/calories burned. The sleep function is interesting. Do I move way more now than I did before I put it on? YES.

I knew that a wrist based product would work better with me (I would lose or wash/dry the waistband/clothing clip-on style). I have had the opportunity to test it against known step counts and distances and it has been remarkably accurate. It is perhaps too simple. Unlike my wife's waistband fit-bit, this model has no LCD display of information. Rather, it has a cryptic set of 5 LED lights which can light up independently or simultaneously, in certain patterns, thereby imparting relevant information, which would be requested by a series of taps designed to communicate one's inquiry such as, \"How many steps have I gone?\" --this would be a double-tap inquiry. If you have achieved 20% of your daily goal, then the answer is one light is solid and the next light will blink at a pace which hastens as the next 20% marker is approached. Got it? If I want to send my unit into sleep monitoring I tap it real fast for more than 2 seconds. Once this monitoring has started, the unit vibrates and blinks two LEDs slowly out. Or mow the grass with a push mower and it it enters the sleep monitoring mode. Anything that shakes your arm will trigger this on and off. However at night when I use it, it is very accurate at monitoring my restfulness. If a short hand Morse-code and blinking light style communication with your pedometer sounds appealing, then the durability and performance will please you - but if you like easy - wait for the next iteration. I still like this product, and owning it has goaded me into 60% more steps than I had been taking. The online component is excellent, but the APPs are not consistent. The Android APP from Fit-Bit which my wife uses is awesome, but my Microsoft 8 APP is disappointingly lacking in the features that I saw in the Android. The charging is easy, but the dongle and the charger could have been combined. Why should I use up two USB slots on my computer for one device? My charges last 6 days easily and I use mine for 12500+ a day. It has never been below 20% -- guess what the charge level - also another informative blinking light display.",

I particularly like that the Flex automatically synchs with the iPhone app whenever I open the app. I find myself checking the app several times each day to see how many steps I've taken toward my daily goal. The food log is very good too. The food database is substantial (though not quite as comprehensive as that of the My Fitness Pal app), and there is an option inputting and logging \"custom foods.\" Another fascinating piece of this tracker is the \"Sleep Log.\" Tap the bracelet before you go to sleep, and again when you wake up, and the log will tell you how much you slept the night, including how many times you awakened during the night. Logging into your Fitbit account on your computer offers even more information on your data. Fitbit Flex is waterproof. I have worn it in the shower a number of times, but I do usually remove it before showering.",

            "review_text": "I'm largely dis-satisfied with this product. I give it two stars because there is one function that I really like: silent vibrating alarm, and it's implemented almost poorly, so not great for my favorite feature. 1) Band fell apart. The band early on started separating at the joint where the LED lights show through. After a while it just fell apart. Quite upset, new band kits are $30. Upset. 1A) Moisture and goop gets into the well that holds the fitbit device. Never dries unless I take it apart clean it and dry it, taking time from my day. 2) Largely useless functionality. The unit only tracks arm (and therefore walking) motion, and has a silent alarm. Everything else you have to manually enter...such as weight, calories eaten, water consumption...everything. Heck that can just be a web site, I don't need a $100 band for that. 2A) I originally got this for the sleep tracking, but that feature is very squirrelly...you have to MANUALLY tell it when you are going to bed and waking up. It doesn't use any \"smarts\" to determine that you are alseep. So you have to constantly adjust and input your waking/sleeping times. The phone app is somewhat useful, but if you forget to set it or tell it you're awake, well you're in for a world of work to sort the data out. On top of that, the app can go to the background on your phone and you never see the \"I'm awake\" button until too late. 2B) Sleep tracking is just not correlated well...for instance how do I know whether I'm a regular sleep or sensitive sleeper? I just don't know and the app doesn't help explain. 3) The fitbit device vibrates when it thinks I did 10,000 steps but sometimes it will vibrate late at night when I am asleep. Huh? why? 4) Battery life is OK, but can die quickly...causing you to miss an alarm. Even though the app says it has medium battery life, it can die the next day. Not well calibrated, and no warning at all. Sometimes I've had it die at night and there was not enough juice for the vibrating alarm. Needs some kind of warning, and better battery life calibration with the app. 5) The battery charging unit is proprietary. Guaranteed you will lose it, or leave it at home on your next trip by mistake.. Fitbit should have used standard universal USB connectors. 6) The user interface is very poor. For instance you tap it to do something...did it register? did it work? How many taps do I have to give it? I don't know, the lights flashed but what do they mean? Sometimes blink, sometimes vibrate...you need a secret decoder ring to figure out what the heck this device is telling you. This is especially bad for the vibrating alarm...tapping snoozes, and tapping turns off the alarm...when you're half asleep, how many taps did you give it? did you just turn it off? I don't know and the lights are too confusing to tell me especially when I'm asleep. 7) If I want to track my walking/energy, now I just use an Android fitness tracker app. The wristband broke and this unit is not going into my drawer of useless junk. Waiting for the next new wearable that will work better.",

It does not track your weights in the gym. 3. It does not magically determine what's on your plate. 4. It does not brew coffee. Yeah - if you needed the previous NOTs you might need this one as well ;) Bottom line: it's not a magic wand, but a fine tool that serves its purpose. And it's also waterproof! ;)",

Getting it to snap shut is a royal pain and yes it does tend to up snap itself on occasion. This is a design flaw that needs to be corrected on a device in this price range. I bought this for my wife and she absolutely hates the strap. We are considering returning the Flex and purchasing the more expensive Fitbit Charge HR mainly to get the more \"watch-like\" strap. We may try one of the third party strap accessories. I'll update this review after my wife has some time to use it.",

I have syncing always on and check it by 'tapping' to see progress dots several times a day, yet I still only need to recharge the tracker every 7-8 days and it only takes maybe an hour or two for a full recharge; pretty nice. But I particularly like the fact it is submergible. The write up on Amazon says it is not submergible, just splash proof basically but if you got to the actual fitbit website and read the specs on the Flex under \"Environmental Requirements,\" it clearly states under \"water resistant\" that it is able to be submerged upto 10 meters (32 feet). The only con I've found is that it can be hard to snap back on after removing the band to charge the tracker. The little clip you have to push through the holes in the wristband is a little cumbersome. I have small fingers and acrylic nails so I can really get in there and push it with little problem but my other family members have more difficulty. Other than that, it's damn-near perfect. Wasn't sure it was accurate in steps since I wear it on my wrist and I tend to gesticulate a lot (so I feared getting excess steps, distance, activity, etc from waving my hands around versus true movement/exercise) but one day my husband and I went everywhere together and at the end our \"distance\" for the day was nearly identical but I had more steps (which make sense since I am short and he is 6', thus his stride is longer than mine so I take more 'steps' to travel the same 'distance;' I was pretty impressed with that level accuracy).",

I have never let mine go very low, I only charge it once a week for a few hours, but I bet it could go 2, maybe even 3 weeks without having to be charged if I really wanted to test it. I ordered the round carrying case to go with it and it's perfect for holding extra bands, the charger, and other small plug in chip for the computer.

I do a lot of ice skating as well, so it's cool to see the distance around the lake, and I try to beat my time around each lap. My only complaint is that the teal band gets dirty really quickly, I think just from stuffing my hands into the pocket of my black jacket. I'll probably end up purchasing a darker band.

The sleep tracking is cool too, but I'm not sure how accurate... But good enough. Really like the alarm function; nice way to wake up. For my third point, I must say I was highly disappointed when the battery didn't charge properly after only 3 weeks. I contacted support through email and I was very impressed with response time and the suggestions leading up to reset. Final analysis was: return it-it's not working. When I learned all my data would be lost if I didn't sync the Flex within 24 hours, I panicked. I went to Best Buy as they extend a warranty for 2 years for an extra 15 bucks. That was very acceptable for me as that way I could sync a new flex to my account and not lose data. I'm wearing the new one and no problems so far... But it's only been 6 days. No matter, I am sold on the product and am thinking about buying the scale FitBit offers. I think I will, only with extended warranty, however. Love my Fitbit!! By the way, I just received my credit in Amazon... They gave me 30 days from date of purchase and with some extra speed and cost it arrived on exactly on the 30th day. I'm satisfied with both Amazon and Fitbit... And Best Buy!",

It could easily be lost if someone didn't notice it falling off. I have noticed that some of Fitbit's more expensive models have a clasp that is similar to a watch. I think they should redesign the flex with a similar clasp. Second, It often is knocked into sleep mode by vibrations such as operating power tools (I suspect using a lawnmower will cause the same problem). Also it usually requires about 10 seconds of very forceful tapping to put it into or out of sleep mode. I believe some of Fitbit's more expensive models automatically detect sleep and therefore do not require setting the sleep mode. Overall I think it is an innovative product that can encourage people to be more active, however it doesn't seem to be rugged enough to withstand the very physical activity that it encourages.",

The calories intake option that you need to log your food in is harder to use ( less food items) other apps like webmd is easier. But at least it has those options for you to help you think healthy. I remove one star because of a couple of reasons. One is it's either too hard or too easy getting on a sleep mode, for example, if you're walking a cart on a tiled floor in a supermarket, it vibrates and turns into sleep mode. When you want it to be on a sleep mode, sometimes you have to try to tap it so hard to change it. The other thing is it comes w both band sizes. I'd rather have it comes in two colors in one size. I assume that this may be because you lost a lot of weight and change the band later? But for example, I'm already in a smaller size, so I hope i don't need to go bigger...from my personal experience, all my guy friends wear big ones and girl friends wear small anyway..",

Information became inaccurate (the iphone app would show that it was fully charged when it was almost fully discharged and steps became way off). I contacted FitBit and they did send me a new one free of charge without hassle. I'm hoping it will last longer, but feel a bit skeptical. So I'm happy with customer service, but not super sure about the product. I agree with other reviewers that this is best used as a pedometer for walking and running, and it won't count your steps if you are pushing a stroller or shopping cart. I'm not sure how accurate it is if you placed it in a pocket, but will have to experiment. I do find it motivating to have on my wrist as a reminder to move.

I thought the unit would reset itself the next day. To my dissapointment, when I awoke, it had already registered over 1,000 steps and 400 calories burned. I must really walk in my sleep. To say the least, I was very disappointed. Also, putting the fitbit on is not user friendly. It is difficult to snap into place. Both units are being returned for a refund. Much of what I have said is reflected in comments of other users who were equally disappointed with this product. Without a doubt, I would not recommend this to anyone.",

Cons: The Android app and the website are the most atrocious works of good idea fairy teamwork I've seen in a long time. It almost feels as though each PM for each little widget was given full admin access to the main design of the site/app and just built whatever they wanted to, with their own idea of what a kick ass website should look/feel like. There's no centralized settings window for what you want, and there are numerous bugs. Half of the settings you have to enter on the site, and the other half of the settings you have to enter through the app. I didn't think it was possible to build such a poorly designed website that is still so functional. Going further- if you want to add a friend, you have to use their email address the registered to their fitbit account. And if you want to add your new friend to a group, you have to again use their email, which is not available data to you as the end user. The actual usefulness of the dashboard page is thoughtfully done, except the complete wanton regard for settings. Pros: They nailed the privacy area, you can see your page as if you are you, a friend, or a stranger, and control who sees all your data. You might have to go back and forth through the app and the website to get it all, but it's not that bad. Try configuring your food/diet plan though, and I have to go for a run to burn off the angst it creates. Perhaps that's by design? Bigger Pro: It's just the website, and that can be easily changed. Fitbit is collecting and protecting all the data they need to keep their product line running, and they've exposed API's to outside devs, so while I hate the Fitbit food entry tool, I can use the MyFitnessPal app/site to do it and it synchs up in real time. The website feels like a horrible V1. I expect the site to mature and get better, and they won't need to re-release the tracker hardware, assuming they stop building hardware that burns people, etc. Biggest Pro: Customer Service. They have a helpdesk that opens individual trouble tickets for you, they are quick to respond, and while their info isn't always completely helpful, they've gotten the job done for me with the two Flex trackers and the Aria I bought. You can quickly see your open and closed tickets on the site, so long as you can find the page again. I'll review the Aria soon. Super cool device, they listened and fixed the pairing problems. But I digress. My thoughts- buy this, and hope they revise their website. But it's worth buying.",

Android phones use mulitple operating systems - hence the compatabiltity issues. My fitbit has been replaced. This one wouldn't charge either wall unit or pc.

I was learning how to use the rest of the tracking features to the best advantage. But not anymore. My Fitbit is gone! The clasp on this thing wasn't too hard to do as I've read in other reviews. The problem is that it is too easy to come UNDONE! The first time it popped off was day three while we were camping. Must have snagged it while setting up my tent. Next thing I know, my wrist was bare. Fortunately I found it. But today it must have popped off again, and this time I can't find it anywhere. I guess it is gone, along with my $100. If they expect you to wear it all the time, the least they could do is make a more secure clasp. Do yourself a favor, if you buy one, also get one of the clasp protectors I've seen online. Of course, I didn't know I needed one until I lost mine. I will NOT be buying another one. Who can afford to throw away $100 in a week? EDIT: Amazon is amazing! Fitbit would not replace my Flex since I did not purchase it from them, however Amazon was willing to replace it. I have only ever had to call Amazon customer service twice, and both times they were incredibly helpful. This is why I love Amazon and will keep my Prime membership. So worth it!",

It happened after doing the dishes, my tracker was non responsive and there was condensation inside of the top of the tracker where it says fitbit. Afterwards I finally got it to charge, but it would only last for 20 minutes but would not track any movement. I contacted Fitbit and conversed with them about the problem. After they concluded that it was not user error I sent them a screen shot of my order form from Amazon and they sent me a new one. Very helpful customer service. But it was still annoying since one of Fitbits main attractions is that it can get wet. I will see if this one holds up better. This is by far the best, and most comfortable tracker that I have had. I had the Nike tracker for a while but it was uncomfortable and not as stylish as the Fitbit, which fits perfectly around my wrist. Very accurate step counter as well as sleep tracker. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get a step counter. Not to mention it is very fun to do with either a group or your family.",

I hoped it would but it has proven to be a real boon to my exercise routine. In the beginning I thought it would just be nice to know how many steps I took in a day and also to see my sleep patterns. It suggests that you set 10,000 steps as your daily goal so I went with it. Then I quickly realized how little I was walking to meet that goal so I began walking my dog more, finding more reasons to walk places, etc. It is now to the point where if I don't get my 10,000 steps every day I am disappointed! This little band makes me so aware of how much (or little) I walk each day that if I now find that it is \"almost\" to my goal, I will find ways to get those last steps in so that I can pat myself on the back for doing more to get in shape. Now, it's not as if I didn't know I was out of shape to begin with; anyone who looked at me could tell that. But wearing this little band and knowing that is monitoring my every step, but in an encouraging way, works for me and keeps me motivated. I love that I can even wear it in the pool because I just started taking water fitness classes at my gym and it counts those water steps too! I can't think of any negatives about it. It's comfortable, was very easy to set up and syncs effortlessly with my Mac desktop or my Samsung phone. If I had any negatives to mention it would be that I wish they sent two of the dongles with it so that I could recharge it at work if the battery goes low. I also wish it counted stairs in addition to steps. I have to log those separately but it is still awesome in every other respect. I love it and highly recommend it.",

I'll start by saying that the concept of this tracker is great, it is suppose to give you a wealth of helpful information that keeps you focused and on track with your health goals. So I was really excited to try it out, and I had read reviews for activity trackers and Fitbit seemed to be the company that got the highest ratings. I'm a personal trainer and a pretty active person, so I was thinking that this would be a great way to keep record of everything I do throughout the day, see when I'm my most productive, as well as keep a regular food and sleep log. Well my experience with this product was such a huge disappointment. Here's how it went: I ordered the Fitbit Flex from Amazon.com and after I installed the software and setup my account, I had an issue right away with the tracker not automatically syncing as it was said to do. I did some troubleshooting and made sure that the device was fully charged, the dongle was being recognized by my computer, and also making sure that my computer was not in hibernation mode. I dealt with this issue by force syncing the tracker and through that was able to get my information and stats. Not a big deal, but already I'm thinking that it's not doing what it claims. By the second day of use, the lights on the tracker went completely off, and it seemed the battery was dead. I left it in its charger over night, making sure that the lights lit up, which they did. I then placed it back in the wristband that morning and noticed by noon that again the lights were off and the battery was dead. At this point I contacted Amazon.com and requested a replacement, hoping that it was just an issue with this particular tracker. I now have the replacement, and the tracker is staying charged, the dongle is finding the Flex and says that it has synced. When I go to my dashboard, it says that I haven't synced since this past Sunday. I've been wearing it daily and no information or stats are loading to the dashboard. I've uninstalled the Fitbit Connect software and re-installed it to see if that is the issue. It is still not working. I've had other people look at it and see if there's something I'm missing, but after checking my computer, it's files, and all it's settings, no one has been able to figure out why the Flex is not working. I've contacted Fitbit a couple times now, and they don't offer phone or online support, so I've been going back and forth with them through emails. I'm at the point now where I'm going to send the second tracker back and just try and get a full refund. It seemed like such a good idea, but I think I'm going to wait until another company comes out with a more reliable product.",

This is way better than any other clip on type tracker, where I start to forget to put it on after about a week. Since the Flex is on my wrist all the time, and tracks my sleep, I almost never leave home without it on accident. I like the tracker in general, and love the sleep tracking abilities. The Flex stays on my wrist pretty reliably- the few times the clasp has come loose while I'm wearing it, I've noticed immediately. All that said, here are the few little annoyances with the fitbit flex. The first one, even though it is safe to wear in the shower, the pocket in the wrist band where the tracker goes gets full of water and can be kind of annoying, so I normally take it off to shower (which is what lead to me forgetting to put it back on one day before leaving the house). Sometimes the tapping function seems to not work so well, making me spend a few minutes tapping at it to signal it to sleep or wake up before it will change modes- but it only does this occasionally, so it may just be something I am doing different that causes it. A great improvement to the Flex, or any fitbit product, would be a heartrate monitor that connects with the Flex so that it can monitor your level of activity based on effort as well as motion, since some things that require a good bit of effort don't register on the Flex due to too little arm movement. Something like bathing the dog, which barely registers via movement, would show up decently in a heart rate increase on a heart rate monitor.",

I find the product to be a very good indicator of how much activity I get during the day, and it confirms my perceptions of what my sleep patterns were like as well. I don't use the fitbit for weight loss, though I do track what I've eaten in order to monitor my fat/sodium/carb intake over a distance of ground (would like to see some stats on sugar intake - that would be helpful for people who want to keep an eye on all the 'hidden' sugar in food). I think the product is useful because it increases my awareness which encourages me to be more active. Things I really like: Product is light on the wrist and easy to take care of - I don't worry if it gets wet. Battery charge lasts for a good five days - and one can set up email/text notification when the battery is low. I love the standard dashboard tools and options (I don't have the premium subscription). I like that I can add custom foods and complete meals - that's a real time saver when I'm logging foods. Things that could be improved on the Dashboard: Foods I've added and logged disappear from the 'recent' foods list after awhile - if I've added a food, it's usually something I eat fairly regularly - but is not necessarily a favorite. One could 'Favorite' everything but then searching for foods among the favorites becomes rather cumbersome - especially since the foods aren't listed in alphabetical order and there is no option to sort them. There are daily totals for fat, carbs, protein, and a number of other important items - it also needs a daily total for sugar. Things that could be improved on the flex wristband: The matte finish of the rubber wrist band tends to be a tiny bit tacky and gets stuck in cloths - it doesn't slide easily on one's wrist or through clothes and that can be annoying when wearing a long sleeve shirt/sweater/jacket. I thought the tackiness would wear off after a few weeks of use, but it has not. It would be better if the finish on the rubber could be smooth like the plastic window. . The pocket where the fitbit goes is not smooth on all sides - there are hidden pockets on either end of the fitbit where moisture gets stuck -- which requires removing the fitbit and drying out the pocket. Though it isn't terribly difficult to dry it out, one wonders why these are even exposed in the pocket to begin with. Overall I've been quite happy with the product and believe it was a good purchase. I would buy it again and I'd recommend it to a friend.",

I think it has something to do with older laptops and computers not understanding the new device... really I think that they should take in to account that not everyone is going to have a new computer. The fitbit has no issues syncing with the dongle to my husbands laptop that is a little over a year old but mine that is 6 years old it will not sync. I understand that the new phones bluetooth is not the same but a usb should transmit no matter what. But that is my opinion! all in all we both enjoy our fitbits and are about to wear them in the Flying Pig relay we are doing with some other friends!:-)My biggest complaint is that my band seems to be wearing and looking a little spotty. Where you put in the device has bubbled out but it still holds the fit bit in well so I guess I will deal... Im kinda wondering if anyone else has had the band do this... its really not the best look :-/ Upon getting my first fitbit I was happy with the set up and installation of software... I was so happy with it that I bought one for a friend and she is so frustrated that she is ready to return it. As that I am pretty good when it comes to technical stuff I decided to bring it home with me and try to get it set up for her using my pc instead of my laptop which i had used for my own fitbit as that she only had a pc. I received the same message she did on her computer... \"No internet connection found\" I unhooked the dongle and it would show on the sync menu when the dongle was connected but it wouldn't allow it to connect no matter how many times I restarted my computer, uninstalled and reinstalled the software and changed USB ports, I also rest the fitbit. still nothing. The other thing is that it will not go into the sleep mode... now I'm not sure if this is because it hasn't been synced to an account yet of if there is really something wrong with the fitbit... we are going to try to connect it to her phone Galaxy S4 tomorrow... if that doesn't work then it will be returned :-( I will update this if we can get it working... I would love to give her fitbit a 5 star review... which is how I would rate mine but one good one and one bad isn't a very good %... I am more dissapointed with fitbit site than amazon... as far as I can see this is not an issue with Amazon but with fitbit and their support... or lack there of.",

Because the clasp is so difficult to close properly I rarely unclasp it. Several people have told me that their fitbits fail shortly after the return period. When you email customer service they try to be helpful but can't do too much. When you call customer service, although you speak with someone in a faraway land, they have been helpful. The good news: it's a great product when it works and motivates you to walk and walk and walk. If the one I currently have lasts long enough so that it's worth the $95 plus or minus, I would buy another when it conks out.",

Great product, very comfortable, once I got used to it, I forget that I have it on.. didn't realize my sleep pattern was so bad, until I started monitoring with Fitbit, it records even when I wake up for 5 minutes. great product.

Connecting this with your phone allows automatic data transfer which is convenient, instead of hooking it into your computer to transfer the data. I wore this for about 3 months straight, then didn't put it on one morning and haven't since. It was a neat gadget when I first got it and actually made me go to the gym a few more times. Overall if you really like to workout, this is worth getting to track your activity. However, if you go to the gym a few times a week, and may skip a week here or there then do not get this.",

My wife is beating me right now so I hear about it daily which I guess is, in part, why we like it so much - it brings out the competitive side of us in a healthy way! Problem is, neither of us can seem to keep it on our wrist. The band falls off almost once per day for me and a few times a week for my wife. It seems to be fully snapped but the band falls off when things rub up against it too hard. You would think for a fitness band they would be well aware that physical activity would be going on while the band was being worn but the clips on the band are not adequate. We are debating taking it back and getting one of the others because we are afraid that it's just a matter of time before we don't notice they fell off and lose them.

I love the Fitbit dashboard and tracking capabilities--buying into the Fitbit world is worth that alone. The wristband itself is great. It holds a charge for 5 days or more. I found that the low battery email/texts Fitbit sends are usually a little late -- my Fitbit seems to have slowed down and be really close to dead by the time that happens. I've taken to carrying the charger with me and checking the battery level manually on the dashboard and charging it before I get the notification. An extra charger would be a great investment, but they're a little pricey for what you're getting. I love that it came with a Large and a Small wristband, because I ended up needing the small one. Being able to sync with my phone is a really great feature too, because I keep the wireless syncing dongle at home. Note, though, that unlike the Fitbit One, the Fitbit Flex does not have an altimeter so you won't get floors climbed. For me, this was a no-brainer trade-off because I like the security of having it on my wrist -- I won't accidentally wash it, I won't accidentally drop it, and it's easy to have it with me all the time. I don't care that much about altitude gain. I got the black band and it scuffs up a little. Most of the scuffs wipe off with some water and a cloth though. Supposedly you can wear it in the shower, but I haven't been bold enough to try it.",

Hardware First, I was very wary in buying product due to all the negativity around the wrist band. Please note, the set I was sent had both the large and small size. I found I could use both in a pinch, but have only used the large. The band is a smooth semisoft rubber, several adjustable slits to fit your wrist. Its very comfortable. I could see it being flimsy if you pull it on and off daily. I have left it on for the 5 days and just haven't picked at it. No problems. You have to understand, you wear the wrist band 24/7. The pushing and pulling through the day, specifically at night has to stress it. My hope is to get 100 miles per wristband....I probably will blow that away as I am seeing no wear and tears and will hit that tomorrow. I found the device easy to load into the band and unload and find the tapping to get updates pretty good. The buzzing is strong enough to wake you in the alarm function and to notify you of sleep mode and other functions, Software I find Fitbits software is the reason this only gets 4 stars. First, devices.. READ WHAT DEVICES THE SUPPORT!!! I made the mistake of buying this product for my wife, figuring that since I have a 4s Iphone, her 4 would work. It doesn't! Ridiculous. Product works great and is easily set up on the 4s Iphone. Works great with my laptop by communicating with a little adapter that sits in a USB port of the laptop. The logging of data is very smooth. Although the food log is primitive. They must be expecting customers to log the statistics of different foods and their customers are letting them down. Not easy to find what you are looking for....they didn't have peanut butter and jelly in there! Stats categories include steps, calories in v out, sleep, wake time, miles, active minutes and weight ect As a pedometer, it's extensive enough to be a serious tracker, I'm just not into it enough yet to get crazy to use it that way. AS a sleep tracker, I love it. I use it the in less sensitive mode and I find it great to give me a real sense of my sleep. They say there is a more sensitive mode, if you have sleep trouble, but I haven' used it. It tracts you sleep, restless and awake points. Mostly by movement of your wrists. Its not exact. Pros: Comfort, Price, Abilities Cons: Software sophistication, # of device supports PS FITBIT I think it sucks you charge $10 more for the black band. Still would have gotten the cobalt, so haha.",

I have no idea how accurately is measures a mile of effort, etc., and have never really cared. For me, the main purpose is that it provides a reliable ongoing measure of my effort and I do not have to track that myself. It is also handy to know how well I am sleeping through the night- it does record when you are more active or wakeful. The web account page is well done. I did not opt for the \"premium\" version. The Flex is durable and water proof. It goes about a week to ten days on a charge. I took a long trip and was pleased that it tracked my information for the entire 7 day trip. Be aware that it will only sync with the pc or tablet that has the dongle installed so you won't see the tracked information until you get back and sync if you are away from it for a long time. I also bought a Withing wireless scale and it was easy to link it all up to my Fitbit account. I tried the Aria- Fitbit version of the wireless scale and had no luck getting it to sync.

The negative side is that the flex has rechargeable battery and you need to charge every 5 to 8 days. It is a pain as slowly the pins in the charger become flattened and it is harder to charge. And the charging contacts on the flex pebble become corroded and you need to carefully clean them. The result is that you need to replace your charging cable periodically.

I am so happy I did! I love not having to wear an armband. The Fitbit is so light I forget I'm wearing it. It seems accurate enough, and I love all of the features included on the Fitbit site . It logs sleep, activity and calories burned, as well as a place to log food, which the Body Media armband did as well, but on top of that, it includes a \"journal\" where you log in your energy level and mood and a place to add comments. I don't recall every seeing a feature like this on the Body Media site. This is a great feature for me, as I am epileptic and this is a great way for me to keep a seizure log and see how it relates to my sleep (or lack of) and activity. Overall I would give it 5 stars, but am forced to give it 4 stars as I have noticed that it sometimes goes into \"sleep\" mode if something bumps it. Fortunately, it vibrates when it goes into \"sleep\" mode, so I know when it's happening, and I can always turn it back into \"daytime\" mode. Other than that, I love it!",

As for everything else...The key to the Fitbit products lies in the software used to track everything. Unfortunately, unlike some others, it doesn't have a heart rate monitor, so any exercise has to be manually logged. For someone like me who does HIIT and heavy weight lifting, I don't feel that the metabolic rate calculated for me before exercise is incredibly accurate, even without a workout, my metabolism would allow me to eat more than a mere 1450 calories a day, so the software is shaky at best. For the average person, however, who might just need a visual of their daily activity versus caloric intake, products like fitness wristbands and trackers can be such a great tool. I got the Fitbit, maybe someday I'll get a Polar with a heart rate monitor, but I don't feel like I need anything more at this particular moment. I am obsessed with my Fitbit and logging my food and I LOVE that the software calculates the ratio of Carbs:Fats:Proteins for you and displays it, because that is so important for people to be aware of when planning their food, even more so than just calories sometimes. About 6 weeks after I got my first one, it stopped charging. Even though it's water proof, if you look on the tracker at eh bottom where the connection is made to the charger, gunk can sometimes get in there and prevent it from charging. This soon led to a defective device, so I contacted Fitbit. Even though I purchased it through Amazon, as it said in the invoice I emailed to them, Fitbit sent me a brand new device with 2-day shipping free of charge, no questions asked, no hoops to jump through. Their customer service is great. From now on, when I take my showers, I leave the little tracker in the charger, so the little daily charge keeps it going and I don't risk the junk build up, and I don't like showering with anything on my wrists anyway. The Fitbit Flex does not provide the most extensive analysis of your activity/metabolism, but I was writing everything in a food journal, using Myfitnesspal.com to track calories and calculating my physical activity on varied calculators online to make sure I stayed on track. So the Fitbit for me really simplified things, and I can also log things on the go from my phone. For a fitness instructor like me, or any serious athlete, I would recommend something that has a heart rate monitor and a better grasp on an individual's BMR. For anyone simply wanting to become more involved with their daily choices and have a better grasp of what they need to maintain a healthy balance, this is a great tool because it's simple, portable, and convenient. Very handy little device, I'd get a Force if I could do it all over, but I am happy for the time being with my Fitbit products. I am a cycling and TRX instructor, as well as an avid power lifter, and of course, I am obsessed with Bikram yoga. I do at least 60 minutes of intense cardiovascular training a day, 6 days a week, and weight train 4-5 days a week. In my opinion, the activity tracking portion is the weakest part of the whole product package, but it's nothing that can't be worked around, and the program allows customized activities be created for those who know how to calculate and factor in their various activities.",

But the biggest problem, and one that the help desk at Fitbit try to glaze over any way they can, is the issue with charging. This device is so difficult to get charged! The battery does last about 5 days between charges, but the frustration when trying to get this thing to charge is really hard to deal with. The charger is a usb charger, so you can plug this into a usb port or using a wall outlet with a usb to 120 plug. Either way, getting the charging to start when plugging it in either way js just short of a miracle. You have to continually unplug and plug, take the Fitbit out of the charger and put it back in, apply pressure and move the bit around in the charger to get it to connect to the contacts to mate and charging to start. Also, it appears there is a continuing build up of corrosion on one connection that needs nearly continuous cleaning. But even when doing this the charging is mostly unsuccessful. All in all, I would highly recommend looking into another, more reliable device for fitness tracking.",

I had to keep pushing the battery up into the charger to make a connection or tap continuously on the battery and after a LOT of tries, it would eventually connect and start to charge. Now, I can't get it to charge at all. I have tried several electrical outlets, several different plugs to put the USB cable into, and several different cables (Fitbit and 3rd party). Plus, the charger never worked in the computer's USB port. What good is the Fitbit if it won't charge? Quality control of the charger, or the battery, perhaps, is extremely poor. I'm not sure if the fault is with the charger cable or the battery size, but it either way doesn't work! I've only had this Fitbit for 3 months. This Fitbit is waste of money.",

I researched and chose this brand because of positive comments about the software. Auto generated weekly summary reports only provide weekly totals and daily averages. For me, this information is meaningless without comparisons (graphs would also be nice). You must go to the online dashboard for better data presentation. There you will find basic data about your steps and sleep. Unfortunately, you must buy their premium service ($50 per year) to look at your weekly sleep reports. Overall, I find the fitbit flex easier to use then a traditional pedometer. Checking data online weekly is working fine for me. However, there is a learning curve to getting full functionality from this device. I am still learning about the various light patterns. Also, I will probably end up spending another $50 per year for premium service in order to better understand my data.",

            "review_text": "I wore my Fitbit for about 6 months, until it fell off my wrist and disappeared. I didn't cry. For one thing, the reason it fell off is because it is very difficult to fasten. If you have a bit of arthritis in your hands, like I do, you won't like this difficulty, and eventually your Fitbit, not quite firmly fastened, will fall off too. The Fitbit software is clever and well-designed, and for a few weeks it's fun to track things like sleep. Once you figure out your sleep pattern, however, you won't care any more. The step tracking is the best part and a good motivator if you need that. Even so, your step patterns will become quite predictable depending on the day of the week and your routine. Alas, other activities don't register well or even at all: gardening, yoga, riding a stationary bike, and so on. It's possible to enter some of these manually, but it's an imperfect science. As for swimming, forget it; you should take it off to swim, and then you're back to the fastening difficulty. I don't count calories or water intake, so I never tracked that. As advertised, the device can be worn in the shower, but there is the potential for skin irritation if you wear it all of the time. Is Fitbit worth the money? If you're still interested but don't want to stick with a simple pedometer, start with the cheapest Fitbit. I wish I'd gone with the clip-on version, if only because the device is sure to improve (and perhaps get cheaper), just like any other electronic device. Maybe I'd even still have it. M. Feldman",

I requested a replacement Flex band, but FitBit a completely new Flex which shows responsive customer service. ----------------------------- This review is for the Fitbit Flex, but also includes a recap of my overall experience with Fitbit as a company. I have been a big supporter of Fitbit products, owning a Force, Flex, Aria and the original Ultra. I purchased the Flex and used it for several months, until the wristband broke. I ordered a replacement (large black) wristband from the Fitbit store, waited over three months, but it never shipped. The lack of an altimeter was also disappointing after using the Ultra. What was even more disappointing was the announcement of the Force, coming just months after I invested in the Flex. The Force included an altimeter and a much needed display. I bit the bullet and purchased a Fitbit Force in late December. I returned home after a workout last weekend to find that my Force was gone from my wrist. Apparently the clasp design is not quite secure enough, and the tracker came off during my workout. After contacting Fitbit customer service, I was told they \"have no way to determine the manufacturing defect of the Force's wristband\". I am among many who have reported issues with the design of the Force wristband clasp. So, now I am back to using my old Flex, with a wristband currently held together by scotch tape. Even if I wanted to purchase a replacement Force, I cannot as it's been taken off the market due to a small percentage of users reporting a skin rash from the band. - A once loyal, now disappointed, heavily invested Fitbit customer",

When connecting to the PC there are multiple dongles you have to use and you have to manually remove the battery/recorder from the wristband whereas with other devices they just pair automatically. For all of its publicity this is the worst device ever and I'd never recommend it to a friend.

If you want to lose weight and depend on calorie count on the device to help you along in your assessments read on. The aspect of calorie count used by you and counted against your calorie burn and the logging in of your calories consumed is hard work. Essentially you do not know the caloric makeups of non-packaged food. So when you make your own meals the task of building up a meal from the scratch ingredients to come to a calorie value is a long slog that one gets tired of quickly. The company should have hundreds more standard home meals on their list of selections not just store purchased microwave dinners and the like. The company should open up up some recipe books like Real Simple and build a meal listing and the published calorie count associated with those meals, etc. and that would be a start. As an example you make a cup of coffee at home with non-dairy creamer and one teaspoon of sugar, this should be on a selection list rather than you having to construct this calorie count from scratch and then enter it. Another example would be 1-chicken breast cooked in olive oil with a side of spinach and medium baked potato. Other issues: I walk up and down steps in my home many times a day but the step count on the device indicates no steps taken. Does not work. One other aspect of this device that was unknown prior to purchase is that this item can provide more information for you about your activities if you want to have it at a cost. I don't remember what those extra information tidbits were at this moment of writing. However the cost is at an unacceptable steep monthly price. So my opinion if they substantially lowered the monthly cost I might subscribe to the \"Extra information\" but absent that price change, NO I would not!",

I have to manually input my readings because I don't notice the battery dies, and I am very disappointed. Until this happened, I loved it. I wore the larger band, walked miles and miles, loved trying to meet my step goals. Now I use the app that came with my phone and I hope that Fitbit creates a better design for the band. Further, the shape of the counter is odd. Why not round, or flatter? It is awkward and I would like to see a flat counter, such as for a small watch face, that is easy to tuck into a locket.

You will definitely want to swap out stories on what you like or how you are doing. When you sync it to your computer/smart phone, you will record information on it like your food, liquid, or any additional activity (over and above what it already recorded as you wore the band.) There are little tiny lit up stars displayed the band that light up when you tap it and it displays 1,2,3,4, or depending if you had a really active day, 5 stars on the actual band. It's quite addicting! This is what helps you get into the habit of \"checking in\" on how healthy you are that day. Then, you will have to go check the computer/smartphone to add your food or liquid.

I wasn't aware of this functionality when I bought it. It was a pleasant surprise as it helps with getting ready for school etc. 5. It can sync both on the laptop using the provided dongle and a smartphone using bluetooth. We use mostly the latter (it is rather slow to sync, but this works seamlessly). 6. It can talk to my Withings wifi/bluetooth scale and updates weight measurements from it within the Fitbit app interface (though I find the Withings software exceedingly frustrating). 7. It can measure a variety of things like steps, distance, most intense minutes, weight, sleep duration and quality, food plan and water (we don't use the latter too). 8. It charges fairly quickly and sends messages when it needs recharge. 9. It comes with a small band that is perfect for my 10 yr old, and a bigger one for adults.

I do have two complaints though with the fitbit app. First fitbit should allow users bring their information from the fitbit app into Apple's healtkit application. They are not doing this right now and it seems to be because Fitbit is making their own device that will compete with Apple's iWatch. My second complain is the nutritional tracking portion of the application is somewhat limited in the types of foods that they have for you to select. Most of the items are not generic versions, but are based on the dishes, and the portion sizes that are served in restaurants. So while the Fitbit Flex is a good product it can still stand to be improved.",

They don't hold up well in the heat if you are always working outside like I do. What I do like is that my wife and I and a few friends can see how well the others in the friends list are doing. This can be a real motivator to walk more. I like and dislike the sleep tracking. You have to remember to tap the device to start or stop sleep tracking. Luckily there is a vibration when it changes because rough roads can change the mode. When it works right the app shows how often you move your arm while you sleep.

Using the FItbit One, I was happy with the tracking mechanism and saw results in my health when I used it. What I did learn with using this product is that I often left it in my pants pockets and even had a few occasions were it fell off my pants altogether when I used the belt connector. This was the main reason I went with the Flex. I didn't have to remember to take it out of my pants because it was on my wrist all the time. So far, I am really happy with the product. The only downside vs the One is the lack of ability to track on the device outside of the goal setting and the limited battery life as compared to the One. I can certainly live with both because 1. I track myself throughout the day using a mobile app on my iPhone 2. the actually device is so much smaller than the one. I can get about 4-5 days on a single charge (as opposed to 10 days on a one).

The problems though put a definite damper on the whole process. One, the tracking devices were a tad inaccurate. The app always under registered the time I exercised, and the steps I was taking. This I could live with though, because after all, I was increasing the time and the steps and the device did definitely encourage me. The real problem was the band on the device. This band is extremely, extremely difficult to attach. I was having so much fun though that once I got it attached I left it on my wrist (holding my hand over the side of the tub so it wouldn't get wet, trying to wash dishes one handed, that's how difficult it was to get attached so that I didn't want to take it off because who knew how long it would take to get attached again). Yes, this is ridiculous for a woman to do this with a $100 device. Fitbit really should have designed this better. And then it came off when I was unaware and I have now lost it. So $100 for a week's worth of fun. Of course I did buy the insurance, but it doesn't cover a band that won't stay attached when you lose it.

This unit tracks arm swings in lieu of steps, so if you are holding a bag (or purse) while walking, or pushing a cart around the store, or keeping your hands warm in your pockets, or walking on soft carpet, this unit design does not track your progress. It's great if you are going for a hike, or a walk/jog around the block. I prefer my $20 pedometer, which is far more accurate at tracking my normal daily activity, but without the fancy online bells and whistles. By the way, my fitbit charger cable will often not make a stable connection for charging, requiring me to re-insert it into the USB charger between 5 and 20 times before it starts charging -- and then I can't bump it or it will stop again. I am now only using it to track my sleep patterns, which it seems to do well. I now have a nice history of how little sleep I get.",

First of all, it doesn't track stairs, which I liked about the One. The Force does, and if I'd known that, I would've paid the extra money and gotten that instead. Second, it doesn't accurately calculate steps. Since it's on your wrist, your hand has to move in a specific motion to trigger a step. So if you're grocery shopping and your hand is on the cart, it's not registering a step. Very annoying. And third, it's very difficult to put on. It gets easier after the first time, but it took some effort. It's not all bad though as there are some good things about it. One, once it's on, it doesn't come off. I've whacked it several times against my treadmill and it doesn't come off. Explains why it's so hard to get on. And two, the battery life is tremendous. If there was a device that captured steps and stairs and went around the ankle, I think you'd have the perfect tracker.",

I wear it constantly and only have to charge it once a week or so, and it fully recharges quickly. 2. you can change the band color easily - just swap the tracker out. 3. you can hook up with friends who are also online and get healthy competition or encouragement going. Things that are just okay about the fitbit flex: 1. the sleep tracker feature counts still movement as \"restless sleep\" even if you aren't asleep. so it says you slept longer than you actually did. 2. if you ever work out on a treadmill, for some reason it doesn't count those steps accurately. when i clock 5.0 miles on a treadmill (really fast walking pace), it says i took about 7-8k steps, when its more like 12-13k steps for me. 3. i realized that it didn't have an altimeter (sp?) in it when i bought it, but didn't realize that after having a step tracker how much i would want that feature. When you're trying to gage the difference between 10k and 15k steps, its cool to know how many floors you've climbed/descended as well. 4. the band shape creates an awkward fit on my wrist. Maybe that just means i have crazy shaped wrists, but i can't seem to get any setting to feel right - either way too tight or too loose. Overall good product, worth the money for basic purposes.",

I just think this technology hasn't been perfected for reliable use yet, or at least not in this price range. I'd have happily paid more to get something that worked better and longer. I first noticed that long walks or runs were not being recorded, so I had to do a hard reset every day or two, no biggie, just a nuisance. But then even with that, I was losing thousands of steps each day, so I started wondering, why bother if it's not going to report accurately? I don't use mind any longer.

Since the positive reviewer claims the Flex clearly wins its 'fight' over the Jawbone Up, I strongly suggest you wait for the technology to be refined by Fitbit (and others) before spending $100 or more on this. I also suggest that you tune out the 5-star \"this is AWESOME!\" reviewers. I've had the Flex for 6 months now (acquired at CES 2013, long before retail availability) and initially I too was impressed by the technology. However, with long-term use, I think its inaccuracies make it nothing more than a pedometer with sleep analysis added in (and the usefulness of the latter is dubious as well). The IDEA of it all is excellent: to track your activities and see your progress over time via the great software that Fitbit has developed. However, all of this is predicated on the device accurately tracking your movements. If it fails in that aspect - and unfortunately it does, to a moderate degree - then all of the data and impressive charts and graphs are rather useless. The \"awesome!\" reviewers don't realize this (yet) and just assume what they're seeing is real; it isn't. The underlying technological problem, as I see it, is in the placement of the tracker. Up until now, Fitbit trackers were to be placed on the torso. Now, it must be placed on the wrist (yes, the tracker itself can be taken out of the wristband and put into your pocket but all of Fitbit's calibrations and algorithms are designed for that wrist placement and you are making the problem worse",

I was initially skeptical that it was little more than a glorified pedometer. The more he used it, the more intrigued I was, until I convinced him to let me borrow it for a week. After testing it out, I am asking for one for my next gift-receiving occasion. The Flex is much better than any pedometer I've ever used. It does over-count steps a bit (especially if you wear it on your dominant hand), but I really like the bracelet-style design, so that's a small drawback. I love that I don't have to think about catching it on my bag (as I would with something fixed to my belt or pants) or having it fall out of my pocket. It's very lightweight and after a day or two I forgot I was wearing it. I prefer the Flex to the Force because of this - I think the Force looks a little clunky for my taste. The Flex certainly isn't high fashion, but it's modern looking and just inconspicuous enough that it doesn't bother me. As for how it compares to a heart-rate monitor: they really are not comparable, but if I had to choose one, I would pick the Flex. I used a heart rate monitor in different, more fitness-focused stages of my life, and it's a great tool for measuring your fitness gains. However, they can be pretty involved, and I still never got comfortable wearing a chest-strap to yoga. The Flex is an awesome tool for tracking steps you take in day-to-day life, which is a pretty good proxy of activity for my husband and I. It may not be adequate for someone looking for more intense fitness tracking (or someone who bikes a lot) Living in a city with a sedentary office job, the amount we each walk in a day varies a lot. The Flex is both a great reminder, tracker, and motivator. The app has a great interface, which is both easy enough to use regularly and involved enough to be helpful and interesting.

Or just keep walking until it buzzes on your arm which means you reached your goal. The first time you try to put on the wrist band, it might be a bit hard to accomplish. Make sure you push the silver clasp all the way through the first side the first time before trying to push it through the second side. And I have found it easier to squeeze the clasp through the second side by pinching the clasp with a finger within the band and another one outside of it. Also, remember to charge the fitbit every four days or so. I charge it when I am working on the computer as I am not missing any steps at that point. There are other options you can use and set by going to the fitbit web site.

The company has no phone number or chat, you have to email them and they said MINIMUM OF TWO DAYS to respond. I can no longer return it, but really it works for 2 months? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK. Good idea in concept but it flat doesn't work and you cannot get any customer service. I will look to try to get it fixed but looks like I will have to wait for them to eventually reply through email, mail it back to them and they will send me a refurbished one (probably sent in for same reason). I have tried all online troubleshooting such as restarting it and it makes no difference. Nothing is wrong with my bluetooth since I use it fine in the car with my itunes. I even tried installing the program on another computer. It simply just quit synching. Not sure why I can't contact Amazon about this, I guess they don't stand behind this product either but it's not an option.",

Either is pretty poor quality for something like this. The band also tore on the side from taking the device out to charge. It's a money sink device, don't buy it.

            "review_text": "I realize that this is evolving technology, but at least one issue seems to just be cheap construction. Watch bands have been around for hundreds of years (it's basically a small belt, right?). Yet the clip of the FitBit is difficult to use, especially if placed on your dominant hand (leaving your weak hand to perform the maneuver). I've seen $1 kids watches with easier clips. While the watch seems to accurately record activity most of the time, the users manual admits that it does better with \"step-based\" activities such as walking. It snowed twice in the week after I started using my FitBit, but it could not accurately record me shoveling my driveway, a great cardio activity if there ever was one. It recorded ZERO \"very active minutes\" when I was working hard for at least 30 minutes each time! On the plus side, it works seamlessly with other apps, such as My Fitness Pal. This is a good way to work around the watches shortcomings, since you can manually enter information such as snow shoveling, which will then sync with the FitBit. MFP also has an easier food tracker, since the FitBit software lacks a barcode reader. There have been many comments on the FitBit community boards, so I expect this will be corrected in a later software version. Overall, I think it's a good fitness gadget. I can tell by dinner time whether I've been active enough for a good dessert, or just some fruit. I hope that some software upgrades may make it better, but if you are a serious fitness person, you might want to avoid disappointment and wait for a new version. 3-stars may be a bit generous, considering all of the hype around this and similar products. UPDATE - I have sent back my FitBit & my wife sent hers, too. We were noticing that it wasn't accurately collecting sleep data. Restless nights seemed no different than normal ones, and it registered no steps or awake time nights when I got up to use the bathroom. I contacted FitBit, who told me that there was a software problem with the sleep monitoring function & they were working on it. That was the last straw. It's a great concept, but I'm going to wait for the technology to mature.",

I have a Samsung Galaxy II and it does not have Bluetooth 4.0. So, in order for me to see where I was at step-wise, I would need to have my laptop with me with the dongle or wait until I get home at night to see where I was at. The lights that show you getting closer to your goal are very nice, but I still would like to be able to see my steps throughout the day. I returned this product after two days for this reason only and purchased the Fitbit One in order to have the display. I really would rather have the wristband since I don't always remember to put it on when I change clothes. The wristband is great because you can just put it on and not have to worry about not having it. Also, the One is so small that I just know I would end up losing it.

Battery lasts a long time, the app for my smartphone is excellent and ties in with MyFitnessPal (for food tracking). Comfortable, fits well, stay on (no problems with the clip). Waterproof is great. Seems very close to accurate (compared to my runs with Nike+ they tend to be very close). Can hold data for 7 days (and has enough battery to make it that long w/o a charge). The Not So Good: Shortly after I got this, the force came out with the altimeter as well as a better display (with a clock which is great) for just $50 more. I felt a little sad that I paid $100 for this when the force came out. I'd recommend a force now instead based on features (I've never used a force). I felt even sadder when mine started to misbehave (see The Bad) The Bad: Both mine and my friends' have started to be extremely intermittent, starting almost at the same time. One of the two chargers doesn't always make great contact and needs a shim to make it charge. They both are having problems connecting to our phones (iPhones, one a 4s and the other is a 5). It often will be unable to find the flex, even when it does find it data is missing. I've updated the software for my phone a few times but it doesn't seem to help. I've not checked to see if the device has a firmware upgrade nor have I contact support, but I will. Depending on how dependable the flex is would determine if I even want to try a force (or recommend it). If I get my flex working I'll probably stick with it.",

Unfortunately, my son was never able to connect the Fitbit to the Internet. He contacted customer service, and I contacted customer service, and though they responded with some solutions, none of them worked. My son's laptop is less than 6 months old, on fairly new operating systems, so that likely wasn't the problem. Fitbit then replaced the wristband with another Fitbit Flex... but that one also doesn't work. Since then, I've contacted customer service repeatedly, but only got one response: that they're \"sorry that their product wasn't the right fit for me,\" and to please return it for a refund. None of my other questions, suggestions or comments were answered. How could we know whether the FitBit is the right fit for us, when we've never been able to try the product?!? Finally, in the last week, three times I've asked to be contacted by a company manager, but have gotten no response yet. I wanted to make sure that the management of Fitbit knew that its customer service representatives have such a casual \"whatever\"-type response to their customers, and that they don't respond to customer concerns. I also wanted management to know that their agents are telling people to \"return the item,\" instead of working to fix the problem. Fitbit has no customer service telephone number which is a big mistake, if their representatives are not giving managers messages to contact a customer. Or maybe they are giving the messages, but the manager doesn't care? Seems I'm unlikely to find out... I'm not getting in touch with anyone!",

I have a job that keeps me really moving so it was great to have an item like this that really told me what I was doing each day. Initially I really liked the Flex, but the shine wore off for me the longer I had it. The first issue is the Flex only synced its information when I was home next to my PC. I know they are not responsible for what phone companies put in cell phones, but its really kind of dumb to have an item like this that doesn't sync its info with your phone and I had a newer phone. I know they have been working on this, but at the end of the day they have an item that is not as user friendly as it should be. My second issue is that it stopped working about six months after I bought it. One day I realized I stopped getting email updates and realized it would no longer update its info on the Fitbit site. It would still charge up, but never did anything else again no matter what I did, even following tech support info from Fitbit. I may just be one of those people that was unlucky enough to get a lemon, but I probably wont buy another Fitbit again. The problem with wearable technology as a whole is its limited in what it can do which mostly makes it a waste of money till people figure out how to make it really work together with the other tech around you.",

There are no readout features on the flex band except for the little lights. I personally like the \"fit one\" a little better because of more readouts.

The rubber band that you put the fit bit in is uncomfortable and itchy. I got a bruise on my wrist from wearing it. They give you 2 bands with only one clasp between the 2 of them. For the price of the item you would think they could afford to put a clasp on each band. I tried he sleep tracker. Apparently I move around too much in my sleep because it says I only get 2 hours of sleep at night. To use their app and online tracker it makes you add \"friends.\" I don't want to force my friends to do this. I'd say don't bother buying this. It's not worth the money.",

            "review_text": "My first Fitbit was the Fitbit One and I LOVE it...but I lost it. So since I can't have nice things, I replaced it with the Fitbit Zip and I liked it ok but it was lacking some features that I liked on the Fitbit One (like counting stairs and sleep). Then that one malfunction past the warranty so I was without any tracker for months. I really missed the motivation they provided so I decided to look into getting another one. When I saw the flex I thought it might be worth a try because if it is on my wrist I won't lose it (which from other reviews I'm not alone in losing the Fitbit One). I've had the flex for almost a week and decided I am going to return it and get another Fitbit One instead. The reasons I personally don't like it... -There isn't a readable display. It shows you dots and every dot is for 2000. I thought this would be ok but I don't like not seeing the number. I have a smart phone but its not one that Fitbits sync with so I couldn't even look at my phone for the number. -I don't like the way it looks on my wrist. I have small wrists and I just don't like the look of it. Also I couldn't figure out how to track my sleep unless I added the time on the website and I found that cumbersome compared to the One. -It doesn't seem accurate. I have it on my right hand (because I wear a watch on my left) and that is my dominate hand. I was not very active yesterday and based on days like that in the past I know I wasn't over 3-4,000 steps yet the Flex said I was over 6,000. I read that if you have an issue with this to try wearing it on your other hand but I don't want to because I still want to wear a watch. I know the newest one, the Force does have a display but I don't think I'd like the look of the bracelet based on how I feel about the One and that other one is bigger. So back to the One I go and hope I don't lose it again. I like Fitbit as a company and the website is really user friendly. It was easy to switch over to my new device and I thought their customer service (when I had issues with my Zip) was really good. So I'm happy to stick with Fitbit.",

Pros: Comes with two different sized bands to fit anyone's wrist. Syncs easily with my home computer FitBit info is displayed on a web site which also maintains history than can be reviewed at any time Cons: I have an iPhone 4...bluetooth of the FitBit is not compatible. You need to have iPhone 4S or later. Light up display only shows 20% increments of your daily goal, so you don't know exactly where you are. Once you exceed goal, all five LEDs are lit, but you have no idea how many steps you have taken until you sync. Unlike FitBit Force, does not track number of flights of stairs climbed. On normal sensitivity, I question its accuracy. It appears to me that hand movements (like washing your hair) are interpreted by the device as steps. While the web site track history, once you leave the current week, it only shows daily total of steps, not weekly total. You have to remove the device to charge it about every 5 days. Overall it is a decent entry-level product for tracking steps but I think for $20-$30 more I could have gotten one that has more functionality.",

We don't really keep up on tracking water (we already know we drink a lot of water!), and some of the other features are just beyond what we need - but oh boy, if you are really dedicated to being healthy, this will help you do it! For me, I was looking forward to the \"quality-of-sleep\" feature, but it doesn't really seem to make much sense to me. I usually take at least an hour to fall asleep, but I never know when I will, so I have to turn on the sleep feature \"just in case.\" So then fitbit assumes that if my arms aren't moving all over the place, I'm asleep, which definitely isn't true, and I really don't get a good reading. It's okay, I still love my fitbit!",

I emailed support and asked them why why my friend's flex tracked all of her minutes and mine did not (while we were walking together). They kept insisting that I was \"pausing\" while walking when I know that I wasn't. I emailed several times asking how I could fix it and they just stopped replying to my emails. Most likely because their is a bug in some of their units and they cannot give an answer and don't want to have to replace it.

I went ahead and figured it had died, even though I didn't get a notification or e-mail saying the battery was low. I charged it in full and put it back on this morning. It was showing all five dots lit up, but it STILL will not work. I went to plug it up again, and it showed all five starts lit up again. I tried to sync it on my phone, and it just says \"Looking\". I do not know what is wrong. :( I paid $100 for this, and have only had it three months; now it isn't working. My uncle has had his about 6 months and his just died too. I am hoping somehow I can get this one replaced, especially since I have only had it for three months. If I somehow can get this one fixed through Fitbit, I will glady give it five stars, because I really really loved this device. :( UPDATE: Thankfully this issue was easily fixed and I am still impressed with this device after owning it a year.",

Honestly, there isn't anything I don't love about it- it has a clean interface, is easy to set up, and makes me be more active by encouraging me to take more steps. Now for the downfalls- I'm on my third fitbit since January. They all work great at first- lasting a week in between charges, syncing quickly, going to sleep well. Then, you start to notice issues. maybe the charge lasts only 3 days. Or it won't sync, so you try to restart it. And restart it again, and again. Then, one day, it is dead. No warning, no battery is low warning, just dead. So, I emailed customer service. They offer some troubleshooting. By my second failure, I had already tried all of that, and gotten nowhere. So, the helpful customer service sent me replacement fitbits. Both times, they worked as described above. Worked great for 3 weeks, then dead. If you look on their blog, lots of people are having issues with charging or syncing, or both. The charge cable barely works, most people have to use a rubberband, tape or a toothpick to keep it in there. I use the rubberband, even when it is working. This is a great product and a great idea, but the frustration level when they constantly break is just crazy. I can't recommend a frustrating product like this until they improve it's longevity.",

It is slim-lined and not bulky like other activity monitors. It syncs to my iPhone, iPad and my pc easily and WIRELESSLY (love this function). The dashboard is easy to read and understand. You can enter in any activity to the dashboard that the Flex does not monitor (which really is anything other than walking/running). Provides good information on your sleep patterns. Cons: In regards to \"Active\" minutes...it only tracks walking/running. And it all honestly, not that accurately. (I have noticed that I will be doing cardio for 40 minutes at the same intensity and it will only log 32 minutes...not sure where the fall off is to this problem.) It does not track biking, climbing stairs (which we all know is much more intense than just walking quickly), not swimming, (even though the Flex is submersible to 10m) and not weight training. This is where I am disappointed. It really is an electronic pedometer. This is where Body Media beats the Flex. I don't love the bulkiness of the Body Media unit but when it comes to my activities and burning calories, etc. I want to see how hard I am working and getting accurate reads. I haven't really used the food log portion of the dashboard, but I do like the sleep information. Again, Body Media provides the same. I read reviews of the UP and wasn't convinced it was any better than the Flex, so...back to the drawing board. I suppose I might just use my Body Media when I am working out to get an accurate read of my workouts. **If you do decide to purchase the Flex, the armband is NOT difficult to close as reported on other reviews. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Latest update: Charge seems to be holding after a 12+ hour charge. * at least that is what it seemed like a day ago. Back down to 1/2 again. I am still not impressed with the Active minutes tracking. My husband and I rode bikes for 3 hours on and off over the weekend...how many active minutes it logged? 0. I even attached it to my shoe to see if it would register, but it did not. I did do Zumba yesterday and it did log my steps and activity accurately. Update: So now I have charged it for the first time and although the lights on the device showed fully charged, when I sync it shows as 1/2 charged. I saw another review that stated that after a week it wouldn't hold a full charge. I am going to try to charge a full 12 or more hours and see if it becomes fully charged and lasts for 5 days. I will update again with the results.",

My husband is and aircraft mechanic so found a cool oring that I've put around the band and it has saved me from loosing it when it pops off my wrist. Luckily, the few times it HAS come off since discovering the O-ring trick have been in my bed or in my house. I find myself CONSTANTLY checking my wrist. I think they need to design it like a watch band and they will have a customer for life. I'm just waiting for someone to have the same cool features with a different band or holding out for them to change their band.

However, since purchasing this product in April, I have had to request 3 replacements. Each time, it was due to a battery issue, where after completed a full charge, the flex dies after a few minutes. Sometimes it comes back to life after a day or two, but then it dies again, then comes back to life...it's just inconsistent. The troubleshooting steps are of no help to me. So I have to keep contacting support to request a replacement, which they are quick in delivering so that's a plus. But considering this seems to be a well documented issue, it's a shame they haven't improved the product. I can't get a refund at this point so I'll keep using the replacements until I find something better.",

I immediately went to the help website and recharged and reset the device to no avail. It still doesn't work. fortunately I found a web forum with a customer service phone number to call and they have sent me an email saying they will replace the device but in the meantime my goals will not be tracked while I wait for the replacement.So that's horrible. For $100.00 I am VERY disappointed with the functionality of this product. I really love the idea of it and for the short time that it did work it was great, but I am really upset that it broke already after only a 2 mile walk. it's not as though I took it for cross fit or a crazy trudging through the mud boot camp obstacle course! I hope fitbit really rushes on the replacement of the faulty device. I hope the next one performs better. :/",

            "review_text": "i was pretty sketchy on the whole idea of a fitness band on your arm. How does it work? Is it accurate? will i become fitter? were the questions i was asking. I have only had it for about a month and it is my best purchase to date. I went on a run on a treadmill for 2kms to see if it had the same distance on the fitbit. it was actually spot on. Mind blown! The next test was a quick walk to my mate house. 1700 steps later i was there. 1700 steps on my fitbit were added bringing me that much closer to my daily goal. i was pretty impresed at this point and i had only had it for a few hours. the next test was doing push ups, and what a waste of a test, a total of 0 steps were taken while doing 20 pushups. My daily goal was not any closer. The sun was setting by this point and i was still 4000 steps from my goal. Dinner time was tense, i was constantly double tapping my fitbit watching the 5 leds light up and then flashing saying i had only done 60% of my daily steps. It was the first day I had it and i was going to let it down already. An after dinner walk with my dog brought me up to 8000 steps, 80% of my goal. It was dark now and it seemed that all hope was fading. I decided to do the dishes and ponder over the shame i will bring to myself if I do not complete my steps. my arm movement in the sink added a few hundred steps to the tally but that was not enough. the waterproofing of the band was an added bonus i almost forgot about. a quick walk around the block before i would go to sleep would surely push me over the edge by now. i was only a few hundred steps away from my goal and it was almost midnight. at 9800 steps i decided to call it quits. time for bed. halfway through brushing my teeth my arm starts to vibrate, a celebratory dance of flashing led lights and pleasing vibrations coming from my toothbrush arm signaled to me that i had won. 10000 steps had been done that day and i could go to bed with a smile on my face ready for the next day. the next day came out of nowhere. bzzzz bzzzz bzzzz startled me at 7:00 am. i looked over to my alarm clock to smack it on the head but no... the alarm was not on. bzzz bzzzz bzzzz again. coming to my senses at this point i realised the silent alarm function on my fitbit was working. the sheer joy of not being woken up by the shrill screach of the monotone alarm made me jump out of bed immediately. the running shoes were on by 7:10 and i was out the door with a banana in my stomach going on a run by 7:15. a few laps around the oval and back home by 7:45. i was buzzing with energy for the rest of the day. by dinner time i was getting push notification off my phone congratulating me for outdoing my daily goal by 2500 steps. i could go to bed smiling once again. while showing off my fitbit to the family the next day. they were so excited by the sleep log that they all wanted to try it out and have a go at seeing how they sleep. i am still trying to get them to buy one so i can compete against them and become the true alpha male of the household. i would consider buying a fit bit for sure if i did not have one already.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic device to have a better estimate of your calorie burn. Also helps with gauging sleep quality. It is an accelerometer that simply measures body movements. However, it is very well designed. First it is sleek and unobtrusive. Secondly it is accurate. If you just move your arm to say pick up a glass from the table it doesn't really increment your \"steps\". However, if you are walking keeping your arm steady it will detect your steps. So pretty good at discerning what is actual calorie-burning activity. Still don't vigorously shake your wrist; the logic only goes so far. It is a small plastic capsule that slides into the snug wristband (two sizes come with it). The charge lasts about 5 days and change. Recharge is fairly quick (a couple of hours). The little leds on the wrist tell you what percentage of the goal you have reached. It does chafe a little if you wear it non-stop for days but it is really minimal (less than a plastic watch). The controls are simple. Double-tap is see progress, rapidly tap it to put it in and out of sleep mode (where it does note smaller movements) and that is it. It syncs either by connecting to your computer after you setup the software. Or by using the included wireless adapter included to be plugged into your computer (about 15-20 foot range). Or by using the free iPhone App. You set your goal either through the iPhone or the Web interface along with setting details, recording body changes, personal physical details for calorie estimation, and a whole slew of sleep, activity, etc., charts and graphs to appeal to those that such things appeal to. It also plots your sleep cycle and presents it graphically. Also it is completely water-proof; you can definitely shower with it. The new one Force Flex is water-resistant so don't shower with that one. That one is a single unit (no slide in capsule) with a more completely OLED display that shows time, Caller ID, exact steps (not light-based progress) and so on. So more features in that one, less need to worry with this one. Depends on what you prefer. I think that covers it. Hit me up if you have questions.",

Based on the number of user \"help\" forums, this particular model has some issues. The first few times I tried to put it on, I found it very difficult and frustrating. (I need a \"medium\" size band, the large is too big and the small is too small.) I'm currently using the large band on the tightest setting. Once you've worn it a while, the holes that you use get a bit stretched and it's easier to put it on. All in all, a good value.",

The flex and the fitbit app that comes with it were exactly the motivation I needed. You can track EVERYTHING from your steps, to exercises, to food, to sleep. I love it. It motivates me to do 10.000 steps or 5 miles of walking a day, and I feel awesome when I hit my goals. It helps me see progress where I didn't before, which is really what I needed. I have used it in the shower and during particularly hard and sweaty workouts and it has given me no problems. All in all its a pretty good product.

It was fine until I took it into the shower with me. They claim that the fitbit is water resistant (NOT WATERPROOF), meaning you can shower with it but can't swim with it. I believe the water damaged it for some reason. After the shower, there was 1 dot lighted on the device that kept staying on throughout the whole night. That probably drained my battery since it died this morning. I tried re-charging it and it seems to be working ok now. Amazon has fanastic and prompt customer service and refunded the $$ to me right away. I ordered a new one to replaced to avoid this frustration happening again. I was going to upgrade to the Force b/c you can actually see the time, calories burned, # of steps on the band. However, after reading so many bad reviews about the poor wristband engineering, I decided to stick with the Flex. It is easy to sync to my phone so my information and progress is readily available. Now between the Polar Loop and the Flex, my husband seems to really like the Loop b/c it does exactly what it advertises to do. It tracks steps, input on how to attain daily goals, calorie burn etc. He likes it simple so it's perfect. I like the Flex better b/c you can see actual distance traveled and the Loop fails to show this. Most of my friends have fitbits so I can compete my goals with theirs and it's motivating. You can also enter in your meals on the flex which I don't think you can do on the Loop.",

I am able to track what I eat, drink, and my activities. The most interesting and eye opening thing is the sleep log. I can see how many times I wake up and how long I slept. That was a real eye opener! This sure beats using a journal or an app. I am so obsessed with this that my boyfriend became interested. I bought him one for a gift and now we compete with each other.

The biggest con in my opinion is: 1) The additional wrist bands are on backorder (that's why they're so pricy on Amazon) 2) The app doesn't work with iPhone 4. Only 4s and 5 All of your goals are 100% customizable and adjustable. It can do as much, or as little as you want. The price was great for everything that it does. I've had it 1 week now and have already lost 5lbs. It for sure is helping me be more active as each day I want to \"get all my dots!\" (That means you hit your goal).

I especially loved the alarm function. On the other hand, my first Flex lasted me just a year before its battery died horribly. Its bands wore out every 2 to 3 months and had to be replaced. This is down to the fact that to recharge it, the user has to bend the band backwards to pop out the flex, putting a lot of wear on the little seams at the bottom. The replacement bands aren't cheap if you buy from Fitbit and generic ones fall apart with a sneeze.",

The snap design is very difficult for people with arthritis or not enough strength to snap it on. I contacted the Fitbit company for assistance, and they offered to sell me the next model up with a buckle band, but after putting out the money for the Flex, I didn't want to put out another $100 or so. I never had to make a decision, as it fell off my wrist and I lost it after 2 months.",

What happens is that I charge it over night, it then behaves properly for about half a day, and then it goes dead. When I sync to it, I see the battery is dead. Must be a common problem because when you go to Fit's help page for the flex, you see a link for the common problem \"Device won't charge.\" I've studied and tried their suggestions but nothing helps. I was using the Fit Bit prior to this (the $49 pocket unit), but after I lost two I figured I needed something tethered to me. But the Fit Flex clearly has some electronics problems. Three days later - the only way to contact Fit is by submitting a problem case. I submitted one three days ago (case 2165052). I check it daily but haven't heard a word from them. My guess, from my experience and comments of many others, is that the Fit Flex tracker has a high failure rate and Fit is unwilling or unable to meet the requests of unhappy customers requesting replacements under their published warranty.",

I like the sleep \"analysis\" part too, although with 3 young kids, I usually can't change my sleep quality. The small issues I have with it are as follows. I went downhill skiing, for 3 days, and there are very few steps tracked during that activity because I guess I wasn't taking steps, but I was being active. Swimming I noticed the same thing, I was tredding water for approximately 10 minutes, but no steps were calculated during that aerobic activity. My other complaints about it focus on the \"sleep\" function, which is activated by tapping multiple times on the device. Other things also can start the sleep option, for instance, clapping my hands a few times in a row puts the Fitbit to sleep, or pushing a grocery cart on a rough surface also engages that function. These are minor inconveniences, but I don't know if it will still track my steps when it thinks I am \"asleep\", so I have to watch it closely if I think I am doing something that may put it to sleep. In general I haven't had any issues with things that others complained about, I think the band is comfy, it is easy to fasten (after the first few days), it doesn't irritate my skin and I have gotten it wet (in the swimming pool) and it still works just fine.

The Fitbit piece itself is awesome and does everything that is supposed to do, but the band is a different story. My band begin to break apart after having it less than one month. It broke on the underside, at the front, where you insert the Fitbit itself. Also, the color immediately got really dingy and gross and looked like I had had it for about a year. I do crossfit type workouts, but I would expect the wristband to be able to withstand vigorous workouts, considering the price of the device. Also, you have two sizes small and large. The large is way to large and the small is a bit snug, but will stretch out. If you decide to buy one I would suggest getting it in black if you do a lot of working out that involves you using different equiptment, sweating and getting on and off the floor a lot. I believe that is what contributed to how gross it started to look after less than a month. Amazon was great in getting me a new device out so that I could switch out the band. PLEASE NOTE that they cannot just send you the band, they have to ship out an entirely new device. They did have it delivered to me on Saturday which ROCKED! I'm now sad, because I really wanted the pink band but if the slate band looks this gross I can't even imagine what the pink band would look like after one use.",

When I put the fitbit inside of the charger, I have to put a support layer back of the product, otherwise it doesn't make the contact with the leads.

I find it convenient to wear the Flex rather than use the pocket version...a few taps on it and blinking dots give an approximate number of steps walked/run that day. It doesn't give the exact number, which some of my friends prefer. If you check the downloaded app on your cell phone, though, the number of steps are accurately displayed. After purchasing the Flex, I realized it did not measure elevations (ex. steps climbed). That is not particularly important to me, but some may prefer that. One downside of the Flex is securing the device on the wrist...I find it very difficult to snap the 2 prongs. Once secured, it stays well-secured, though. The Flex has gotten me moving...I look forward to the daily \"buzz\" from my Flex when I reach my goal.",

            "review_text": "First off I also have a Fitbit Ultra (superceeded by the One?) and a Fiturbo U3 to compare the Flex against. Of the three units my favorite is the Fitbit Ultra. I gave this 3 stars because while it works well the display on the Flex is pretty minimal and the control for the unit is done by tapping it which is a pretty nebulous process most of the time. The data collected by all three are consistent and the steps measured and the sleep data are all within a small range of difference so any of these will collect good data. Fitbit software is pretty easy to set up and runs well although you have to use their web site to view the data (I'd rather have the download and analysis software on my PC but web seems to be the wave of the future). I use these units mostly to monitor my sleep and counting steps is secondary for me. The Flex is a very tiny unit, probably 1/3 the physical size of any of the other unit that I've seen. Putting the actual tracker in and out of the wrist band is kind of a pain but you really only have to do it every 3 or 4 days to charge it as normally it will download the data wirelessly to the USB receiver. The Flex comes with a small and large wrist band and I have to use the large wrist band on the last available notch so if the circumfrence of your wrist is more than 8 inches the large wrist band might not fit. To control the functions of the Flex you have to tap the wrist band or the unit itself and maybe i'm not doing it right but it always seems to take a random number of taps to get what I want. Fortunately when putting it into sleep mode it will vibrate when entering and exiting sleep mode so you know it actually is ready to track sleep. The display consists of 4 tiny, although very brite LEDs, that flash in various patterns to show status. I like being able to push a button and seeing a display of steps or time that the Ultra and U3 will display. The Flex is a fine, quality unit but the lack of a display and the quirky nature of the tap controls caused me to downgrade to 3 stars where the Fitbit Ultra would get 5 stars.",

            "review_text": "I've been wearing this since August 21st of 2013. With that being said, I think enough time has passed to make a proper assessment of the product. I like it! I read a few articles here and there about various wrist trackers before I bought this one, and I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase. Lets get the pros/cons out of the way: Pros: - Battery lasts *longer* than Fitbit advertises. They advertise 5 days, but I easily get a week to a week and a half, depending on activity. - Hardly notice it on my wrist, wears in the shower just fine. - Monitors pretty much everything I want, and the website works great - They made awesome updates to the mobile app recently Cons: - Limited smartphone sync support (more on this later) - The wristband design *can* lend to foul smells (more on this later as well) The pros definitely outweigh the cons, though. I was slightly disappointed (and admittedly, stupid about this) in finding out that Bluetooth 4.0 is not backwards compatible, which means I couldn't sync with my smartphone. The fact that it could wirelessly sync (while the Jawbone Up couldn't) really appealed to me. However, the package comes with a Bluetooth 4.0 dongle that works very well with OS X and Windows (no Linux unfortunately :( ). I've relegated my Mac to a Fitbit sync machine, and it works perfectly. I wanted to sync as much as possible, but I've come to realize that you really don't need to. You just go about your day, then sync whenever you happen to get within 20 feet of your computer. It's all automatic, and uploads the results immediately to fitbit.com (along with the mobile app). As for everyone talking about the smell, this definitely seems true. However, what I do is just remove the fitbit from the wristband once a day, blow out any moisture, and put it back. It's a 30 second process, and as a result, I've never had a funky smell from my fitbit. I highly recommend doing this, and it's not much of a hassle, so.... All in all, I'm very satisfied. I only took a star away because of the small smartphone support. UPDATE 12/27/13: I recently got a new phone (the Moto X; fantastic phone by the way!), and Fitbit happened to add support for smartphone syncing. I'm even happier than I was before, so I added another star :). The app is really neat as well, as you can track your steps live. It's a little bit buggy sometimes with syncing, but it will always sync on the second try, then remain connected. It's honestly not even a bother, so meh. I plan on using this tracker until it just completely dies, then upgrade to the Force :) UPDATE 5/3/14: I've reduced my review from 5 to 3 stars, and this is for the fact that I have been through two wristbands already. The slot where you put the Flex becomes cracked if you do my daily habit of removing the Flex to clear out the moisture inside. This is a tremendous design flaw in itself; I shouldn't have to worry about the wristband cracking, especially since I want to remove gross bacteria from the inside. If this continues, I might just have to switch over to the Jawbone UP24, because this is getting ridiculous. UPDATE 3/14/15: I completely stopped using my Flex. Reason being is that it completely died after only a year of usage. Fitbit replaced it, however, having the unit completely die on me left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not sure I can really recommend this product anymore",

I've not used the additional logs for food, heart rate, blood glucose, and blood pressure. No huge surprise that I'm too sedentary. The surprise was with my sleep. I would have sworn I was getting more sleep and sleeping like a log. Flex tells me the brutal truth that I am way below the amount of sleep I need and am way more restless during the little sleep I do get. I am trying slowly, but surely, to increase the amount of sleep I get. I have a bit of frustration while gardening because some of my activities create enough vibration to cause the device to think I'm going to sleep. I've worn it in the shower from the beginning and everything still works well. In fact, the only time I've removed it except for recharging was for a formal event (and only because I could not find a bracelet that would camouflage it well enough!!). I would recommend this device. It gives you a reality check and could motivate you to make some adjustments for a healthier lifestyle. It gets 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it can't tell when I'm gardening. :-)",

And again, if Omron would get it together, I'd be over there in a flash. But alas, they are not and so this is what I am left with. I've already purchased two of these things (and three FitBit Ones prior to this!) and I have a third in the box ready to go when my current one goes bad which it will. The issue for me here is the battery. The way it works for me is that first it becomes more and more difficult to get the battery to charge in the USB device (even after thorough cleaning of the contacts) and then that is shortly followed by an inability to hold a charge at all. The final step is the trash. Like I said, I am able to write these off as a business expense but for anyone who doesn't want to spend $500 a year on something like this, you may want to look elsewhere.

If you are not a smart phone user and want that ability, you should consider spending the extra $30 to get the Force. That said, I love the Flex. I am interested in seeing what my regular routine is like in terms of actual activity, and the Flex is perfect for that. Between work and school and home I walk a lot everyday, but now I can see figures on how active I am in each facet of my life. The 15 minute tracking cycle is awesome, as it lets me compare my stats to what I was doing at the time more easily than would hourly stats or daily totals. The sleep tracker is great, as long as you remember to tap out of sleep mode when you wake up. The food log is easy to use, and it's also easy to input the calorie values from home recipes (after you calculate them yourself, that is). The battery last for at least 5 days. The band (it comes with 1 large and 1 small) is comfortable enough that it can easily be worn 24-7 until the battery needs to be charged again. I wear mine to work, to school, in the shower, to sleep, etc. I don't take it off until I have to, and I don't even really notice it.

You need some time to input what you eat if you want to track your calories, but the number of steps you take and the amount of sleep you get is automatically charted and added to your dashboard so you can see what's happening. I was especially interested in the quality of the sleep I get and have changed some of my habits based on the feedback the Fitbit provides. I now go to bed earlier because I see that I always wake at 5 or 5:30. When you go to bed at 1 or 2 am, it's just not enough sleep. I now feel better and have more energy.

This is my 2nd fitbit device; I've upgraded from the fitbit one, and the boyfriend will inherit it next week. Reason for upgrade - I kept losing the Fitbit One in the laundry, so I wanted to try the bracelet so that I'd not forget to wear it before spontaneous urges to go walking or do errands. One the 3rd Day, I plugged the device in to \"top off\" the charge. I'm not sure what the charge value requirements are but I think I had it plugged into a legacy USB 1.0 hub, it appeared to charge but wouldn't wake up when I removed it from the device, and would only sync while attached to USB. After a SUNDAY email to fitbit, I got a reply back from Support Analyst 'Ana B' that very evening (!!!) about the reset process that involved the charging dongle. Upon reset, it lit right up, and it occurred to me I may have charged it from a legacy USB hub. I plugged into a known good USB 2.0 port and gave it a few hours and its back to it's full glory. (It probably didn't need that long.) Ana B. at Fitbit support, you're wonderful! What I like most about it: Syncs with Android Bluetooth 4.0 devices wirelessly, and needs NO PC setup unless you want it. My household PCs are all linux, and I hate being told to use windows for something that should be 100% percent wireless. THIS FITS THE BILL! Does the sleep logging; I work 3rds and am night owl so keeping on top of my sleep is vital, and the android scheduling tool handles my weird sleep schedule perfectly. Software app: Very robust, great food catalogue that you can modify as needed, this is a huge bonus for my particular goal and is low-carb friendly in the sense that it gives pretty accurate counts and listings. Wristband - 2 bands in your color choice come with the flex, a larger size for guys and a smaller one for women. I wear the wrist band upside down, and it looks very subtle, like any other livestrong - style wristband. Even right side up on my wrist it's very unobstrusive and not bulky. Durability, So far I've gotten it submerged in water 3 times while gardening, so issues. Things to be aware of - -- Bracelet Fastener is small and could be lost, keep track of it -- tracker itself if you get \"black\" is small and potentially hard to find if you remove from wristband, keep it with its charger if you need to clean the wristband separately for any reason. - If you are an Android 'Custom Rom user', confirm your ROM has enabled Bluetooth 4 if your device supports it, this was once an issue for me on my previous device. I can happily endorse this the Flex as it makes getting out to exercise much easier to track and not have to worry, \"Where did I leave my pedometer THIS time?\"",

It does take a bit of practice remembering it all because, at least for me I wasn't paying very close attention to the things I should have been. What was I eating, how I was sleeping etc. So in my case I can say that it has helped make me honest in what I am doing to my body. Having to type out that I ate the Cadbury egg and the bag of gummy bunnies was eye opening when I saw how many steps I was going to have to take haha. I am not overweight or truly out of shape but I am turning 50 soon and want to be able to live a long active life. Being observant to how I treat the vessel I am given to live out my days seems important. Back to the Fitbit: It is comfortable to wear, after a few minutes you almost forget you have it on.

Cons: Its very difficult to switch between modes with the limited display window and the lack of a physical button to depress. No inactivity alarm or power nap mode. Up Pros: The most \"Stylish\" of the wearable tech options. Easy to control the modes and know which mode you are in. Power nap function is awesome. Inactivity alarms helps remind me to get up and move after long hours of sitting at the desk on the computer. Sleep tracking. Cons: The edge of the button is actually quite sharp and I've scratched myself with it a few times. I usually end up wearing it upside down for that reason. Its not as comfortable to wear depending on the size of your forearm. Plugging in to sync using the headphone jack is a huge pain. Battery never lasts 10 days. Fuel Band Pros: LED Display is the best out of the three Functional watch iPhone App, Badges and Nike + Community Battery Life Cons: No sleep tracking Nike Fuel points are an arbitrary unit of measure (but smart marketing by Nike) The spring latching mechanism wears our after about a year of use.

I did finally find a Customer Support phone number online today after a little Internet searching - 877-623-4997.

Follow up: Never got the shipment confirmation mentioned in their e-mail message but did receive the replacement bands on 8/29/14. I'm happy they delivered as promised.",

I've always wanted to know how restless I am at night and this does that by tracking your movement when in sleep mode. The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't track your heart rate and therefore during workouts when I'm doing movements such as push-ups or mountain climbers, i.e., movements where my arms aren't moving, it can't detect that and therefore won't count it. However, on the app you can log your activities and if you enter in the amount of calories burned, it will then compensate for that on your activity log. Speaking of the activity log, you can also track your food consumption which is amazing. When it comes to diet and exercise my biggest downfall is the diet and with this it tells me how many calories I've consumed/how many more can consume and tracks consumption of protein, fiber, sodium, etc. All in all I give this little tracker a 4 out of 5. One final recommendation is that you purchase an extra band; one for daily wear and another for working out. This way you can let the exercise band air-out between uses.",

Second, the charger that came with it quit working within three months time. They tell you to clean it with alcohol, etc. I did. Still didn't charge. I wound up buying a knock off charger here from Amazon that so far works great. Probably if you contacted Fitbit, they would send a new charger, but you shouldn't have to do that. The charger should work for a much longer time. Third, the apps for Windows phone and Kindle Fire aren't fully functional. If you have an iPhone, I think they are better. And finally, holds a charge for five days. For this kind of device it would be nice if this was longer. The BEST thing about the Fitbit is that it is the device most people have.

Now, it's mostly become a conversation piece and whenever someone asks I have lots of reasons to tell them it's not worth it. When I first got it, I was excited and started tracking. It was useful in helping me realize that even though I'm pretty active in general, I am nowhere near as active as I thought. So it prompted me think about ways to incorporate a little more walking into my day and to get a feel for what my commute should look like if I want to hit my 10,000 steps. After that, the value add was pretty minimal which was fine because about 2 weeks in, the band split in half and I wasn't able to use it. I did email Fitbit and after making me take and label photos, they promised to send a new one within 7-10 business days. Maybe I'm spoiled by Amazon Prime, but that seemed like a ridiculous amount of time to wait for a replacement. I do use RunKeeper to track my runs and was most inspired to get on the wait list for the Flex after seeing a post that said the two could be synced. And that's one of my biggest disappointments. You can pull FitBit data into RunKeeper, but not the other way around. So backwards if the idea is to track all of my activities in FitBit -- I don't want to track my every day steps in my running app. Another thing that missed the mark for me is activity and calorie tracking. They have placeholders for them, but there's no real integration with the actual tracker. I think it assumes I burn a certain number of calories just based on my height/weight so my log shows me burning the same amount for days I didn't even wear it. It might make slight adjustments based on my total steps, but it doesn't really account for any difference in steps when I'm walking or running. Any activity beyond walking and sleeping needs to be manually entered. I don't ever go to the website dashboard, but it seems (based on a few surveys I received) like they've put more energy into that than the mobile app, which is a shame. For a brief period, I was using the food and water tracker via the iOS app, but the food search gets a bit wonky and hard to use. I was interested in tracking my sleep and did find it somewhat interesting to see that information...if only they did a little more to help educate me on what is normal. I am currently not wearing it because it's stopped taking a charge. I don't miss it.",

I experimented with the same distance a few times; 4000 steps for walk, 3900 steps for brisk walk, 3700 for running. The fact brisk step and run has bigger steps, should indicate significantly less steps for each type of activity. That is a big red flag for me. It is very dependent on how wildly you may swing your arm and there is not much intelligence to distinguish the difference. To be fair, this is the same shortcomings for all wristband type of speedometer. My biggest issue with the Flex is the band. It came apart after 2 months of semi-rigorous use. I use it during work, exercise and sleep. In fact I only took it off when I need to charge it. The band came apart where the display portion is located. I also had issues with the charging. I had to tape the Fitbit to the charging cable tightly so the contact can be maintain for charging. Despite all the shortcomings, the Flex is a very capable activity monitor. I wish the item is better made. Battery life is good if you synch 1-3 times a day. A single charge will last you approximately 5 days. I think the manufacturer recognizes the issues when designing the Fitbit Force. I think the manufacturer should send all current owners an extra set of bands. I ordered new ones, but they are in backorder. I wonder why... Pros: Does pretty good job of monitoring single type of activities. A single charge lasts almost a week. Cons: Could not consistently measure a mix of activity. Charging cable could not maintain contact Band not very durable.",

It is waterproof, but I have not tested this part of it, I just take it off when showering and getting into the spa, just out of habit, but I like the fact that if I forget to take it off that it is waterproof. One of the reasons I bought this is that I could not loose it or launder it as I might with the flex one. One thing I do not like is it does not measure vertical steps like stairs or climbing hills as the Flex One does. That was a disappointment as I am trying to increase the intensity of my work out and don't get the credit for the hills. I do enjoy tracking my steps online and logging the food, keeps me on track. Oh yes, the battery stays charged for almost a week, about every six days I need to charge it. I like the sleep function as well. It records every time you wake up so that could be handy to maybe record if you think you might have breathing problems that wake you up at night. Still trying to get use to the buzz vibration when I reach my 10,000 steps. A couple of times when working out in the garden it would go off and I would wildly shake my arm thinking I had a bug on it! All in all I love this little devise. I would hope in the future they could make an update for the stairs. Added Note: I see just today that they made a pink version for breast cancer awareness, I would love to have the pink band to show my support, but at this time it is only available as the full FitFlex and not the band only. I bought mine just a few weeks early. :( You have to buy the pink FitFlex on their web site and not here on Amazon.",

Although I don't pay any attention to the silly achievement badges or smiley face pats on the back, I do find that just having a way to monitor and track my activity has really pushed me to up my activity level on a regular basis--and isn't that why most of us buy these gizmos?

I haven't really used a number of the features, such as the food and water consumption or the social media aspect, and don't really plan on it. Trying to log the calorie content of various foods strikes me as a fool's errand as evidenced by the enormous range of values listed under apple, for example. But for those intrepid users to whom that is an important consideration, the Flex certainly offers users the option of logging calorie intake. The one thing I'm not sure about is the distance and calories burned data that is created as one moves through the day. I expect the Flex uses some sort of average based on the height and weight data users enter (plus I would guess an enormous database) and my guess is these are \"good enough\" numbers, but I am currently in the process of checking the Flex's results against another GPS-based distance recorder I use to see how it stacks up.

I love how it vibrates and flashes when I meet my goal and syncs with myfitnesspal. I found the food database to be lacking, but the seamless sync with myfitnesspal removes that problem. It also syncs with challenges I do through my company on ShapeUp.com. Sometimes it forgets to warn me about the low battery and it dies without me realizing. but mostly that is not a problem. I bought a second dongle and charger so I could keep one at work, since my phone can't sync with it. Planning my next cell phone to be one that will sync with it. Also want to get the Aria scale, which will keep my weight tracked with the FitBit.",

I'm constantly thinking about my \"steps\". I find myself parking further away and taking the stairs more often so i can get more steps. The steps aren't 100% accurate because it will pick up some arm movement and count it. I feel that this for the most part will even out because you may be holding something in your hands at other times and it doesn't count steps when you are actually moving. I have used it while on my treadmill and it seems to be pretty acurate on the milage walked. I also use the sleep function on it very often. I know there are times that I have been awake that it doesn't show in the app but maybe I didn't move my arm enough to show I was awake. It is interesting to see how restless I am when I sleep. If you're thinking about purchasing this strictly for the sleep function, there may be a better option out there. I do definitely recommend the flex for walking and exercise. I find myself now bonding with anyone I see wearing it. Its fun!",

            "review_text": "The Flex is pretty rad. I wear it all the time and it does a pretty darn good job of recording my daily activities (aside from stairs climbed). I find it to be rather motivating too, in that I check the app on my phone and know how much more I need to move my buns to reach my daily goal. The band itself is about the same as wearing a watch, there is a single strip of 5 small LED lights on it that show you approx. how far you have to reach your goal too. It's not so great at knowing that you are on a bike, using an elliptical, or other activities of that nature; however, you can input them manually via the website (not via the app). I do also wish that it had a slightly better method of waking you, (like the competition's band that vibrates at the lightest part of your sleep cycle), but I usually wake up before my Flex alarm goes off anyway. The battery does last about 4-5 days, and takes roughly 2 hours to completely recharge, which I usually do when Im being inactive (like right now while typing this review). The website and the phone app tell you how much juice your flex has left too. There are a couple features on the website that you have to pay extra for, like the \"trainer\" which shifts your daily goals automatically to increase your activity level. I have not used the food/calorie database with Fitbit though, I had been using myfitnesspal before I purchased the Flex and it syncs up with the Fitbit app automatically. However, I may give it a go one of these days to see how it is. Ultimately, I am very happy I purchased the Flex, it is a fairly useful tool for keeping my health and activity on the right track.",

            "review_text": "Many of my online friends have Fitbits of several varieties. We had been supporting each other in our weight loss and health goals for years, and this seemed like a fun tool to help us do it. I glanced at descriptions of Fitbit products, and considered the comments my friends had made (seems like everyone had lost or washed their Fitbit at least once), I decided that a water resistant band you wore 24/7 was the style for me. It is comfortable, not unattractive - I suppose most people assume it is just one of those rubber bracelets so many wear these days or some weird watch. The first time I put it on was a bit of a struggle, in fact, it recorded that I burned 54 calories just getting it on, lol. It isn't as difficult now that it's been done a few times. It's only come off by accident once: I was struggling with my 110 lb. dog's collar and leash, trying to get her away from the chickens and back in the house. I had the leash wrapped around my wrist, and in the confusion, it came off. The good thing was, since it is a rubber bracelet, as soon as I got the leash of my wrist, I felt the cool air on my damp wrist where the bracelet had been and knew it was gone - I found it immediately! I lost 10lbs. in the first 7 days I owned the Flex, just using the dashboard to log my foods (count calories), and trying to meet my steps and activity goals. Pretty shocking. I've slowed down since then, as expected, but I am still very enthusiastic about the benefits of owning a Fitbit to encourage your journey to a healthier lifestyle. Why did I give only 4 stars? Well frankly, because I think the Flex could be better. I know it's a tiny little capsule-like device, shoved into a bracelet holder, but I bet they could have figured out a way to put some sort of display on it. Unless you have one of the few smart phones that will actually sync with the flex, the only clues you get to how you are doing are little ambiguously flashing lights, and even if you have the right phone, who wants to stop in the middle of working out to turn on their phone, open an app, and wait for it to sync? I was so frustrated the first few days I had the Flex, I nearly sent it back. How close was I to 10,000 steps? All it would tell me is 0-20,21-40,41-60,61-80, or 81-100% towards my goal. Picture this: 8pm, my Flex shows 4 lights. Am I nearly 4000 steps away from my goal so I should just forget it, or am I just a quick walk down the street away? I think all the other Fitbit devices have numeric displays, the Flex only communicates through flashing dots and vibrations. After a few weeks of use, I still have a little \"display\" envy, but am satisfied with my purchase. Long battery life, easy to wear, being able to wear it in the shower or swimming, and the fact it isn't easy to lose, are all virtues that help me squash that jealous feeling and remember to love my Flex :)",

First it is inaccurate - I sit in a rocking chair every evening and I believe it is counting the rocking as steps. For example a couple days ago I walked 2 miles in the morning and went grocery shopping and at the end of the day it logged over 40,000 steps which couldn't be correct. In fact I got an alert in the evening that I reached 35,000 steps and then when I went to bed it said I had 40,000 and I did nothing in between but sit on rocking chair and watch TV and logged 5,000 miles in a couple hours. Secondly, the actual wrist band pulled apart near where the the lights after less than 3 weeks and can't be fixed. I then started using the smaller one and can see it pulling apart already as well. I have stopped wearing at this point since it is inaccurate and 2nd wristband is about to break. I want to return but am 12 days past return policy so now I am stuck with $100 item that doesn't work properly. Save the money and just buy a cheap pedometer if you want to track your steps and this was definite waste of money",

I especially like the sleep tracking since I often wake in the night. This has been great to see that pattern.

You enter what you eat, how much water you drink, calorie intake etc. It does the sleep monitor automatically if you put it into sleep mode. I like it.",

Pros: -Nice pedometer and it pairs nicely (by bluetooth) to my iPhone. -I've seen reviews saying it's not very accurate. One of the first things I did was walk/run on a treadmill for 2 miles. The treadmill said I had gone 1.96 miles and the Fitbit said 1.91 miles. Fitbit also said I had gone 4092 steps and I generally think that 1 mile=2000 steps so that all seemed pretty accurate. -Nice interface on wireless devices. Also relatively easy to also track your eating in the app. Cons: -I walk/run quite a bit so it works well for me but it's not a great tracker for other types of activities (stairs-no altimeter, cleaning, gardening, etc) -I haven't decided if I think the sleep thing is at all accurate. I'm up several times a night with kids and it definitely catches that. The restless vs sleep readings don't seem to correlate with how well I thought I slept so maybe it's not very accurate or maybe I'm getting much less sleep than I thought. -Several of the features cannot be changed on the app you need to access either the Fitbit website or use the desktop client. I think there are additional features that require the desktop client.",

While those are excellent products and extremely accurate, I could not get past the issue that the connector irritated my skin and made my arm very sore. That product does not allow for arm switching, so you are stuck with it on the left. Ultimately, I had to give it up. I was very concerned that the Flex would not be as accurate. I wore both the Flex and the BodyMedia FIT for a week to compare. The results: - Both products are very similar in calorie expenditure methodology. I never had a greater spread than 70 calories between the two systems. - Both products sync very well with the iPhone and work well. - Both products have a very long battery life. - The BodyMedia FIT does draw more attention. It looks more like a medical device and can be seen through many fitted style tops. The Flex does not garner this attention and I have only been asked about it once in the three weeks I have been wearing it. - The Flex does not recognize that you have fallen asleep. You must tell it when you are going to sleep and when you have woken up for it to analyze your sleep patterns. BodyMedia FIT does recognize sleep. - The Flex is very comfortable. The BodyMedia FIT is comfortable for a while, but eventually the skin and arm will be very tender. - There is no mandatory subscription with the Flex. There is an add-on, but I have not purchased it. Basic accounts, which are quite sufficient (calories in/out, steps, weight, sleep, water), are free with purchase. Overall I am very happy with the Fitbit Flex and believe it will help me accomplish my fitness goals.",

I like the feature that sends me an email if I have forgotten to recharge the battery, before I have a power loss and any loss of data.

I was already tracking my food on MyFitnessPal.com and I found that the Fitbit website can be linked to MyFitnessPal. In fact I would recommend that as MyFitnessPal has many more foods in their database and gives you a way to scan a bar code. The summary information for your food will show up on Fitbit and give you a place to see your complete fitness picture. I also had a Withings scale and was worried that it would not work with Fitbit. Nothing to worry about. They make it obvious that Fitbit works with the Aria scale but the Fitbit site will also synchronize with the Withings site to get your weight and body fat measurements. In short I recommend the Fitbit Flex as an easy way to monitor your activity level and I highly recommend the Fitbit web site as a place to integrate your fitness tools.",

My skin is sensitive to a number of things, and the materials the Fitbit Flex's band is made of don't cause any reaction (unlike other bands on the market). I've had no problems synching the pedometer either to my iPhone, or to my desktop computer via the supplied USB plug-in. That being said, I wish the device held up a bit better. My Flex's first band broke after about 10 months, and the battery life of the pedometer abruptly dropped from about a week (new) to about 3 days after about the same length of time. The worst part about the worn-out battery is that the pedometer no longer gives me a warning on my phone when it needs to be charged -- the pedometer just stops responding until I recharge it.

            "review_text": "I bought this for myself and my mother because we wanted to do something together to keep us motivated to lose weight and eat healthier. We have been using it for a week and a half so far. As others have mentioned, the device is not perfect if you want to put it under a microscope for how accurate it measures steps and calories burned for different types of activities. However, it does a great job measuring overall daily activity as a whole and motivates you to reach your goals each day. So you may be doing a little more than you need but there is nothing wrong with that. On the Fitbit website you set your weight loss and food plan goals then follow what it tells you for calories in and calories out. The hardest plan focuses on losing 2 pounds a week and following the plan closely, I lost 2.4 pounds after week 1. My mother lost about 1.8 also on the hard 2 pounds a week plan. My mother absolutely loves it and you can't get her to stop checking her stats and going out for walks. The website was very flaky the first few days I used it but seems to have stabilized since then. So if you are looking for an overall activity tracker and motivator to lose weight or stay in shape, I recommend the Flex. If you need something that is 100% accurate counting every step of the day or most of your activities do not involve arm movement, the Flex might not be for you. Keep in mind that for those activities that do not log as you would expect, you can enter them manually on the site and will replace what the Flex logged for that time period so you do not double dip. UPDATE 8/29/2013: Forgot to mention in my original review that the support for Android devices is very limited. I have a Galaxy Nexus with updated Android 4.3 which supports the Bluetooth that is required but Fitbit has not updated the app to support it. If phone sync is important, check the site to see if your phone is supported.",

Fitbit really dropped the ball on this device considering the features offered on their other devices. Here is why: -it doesn't count stairs -no data is displayed on the device except some flashing lights-useless enough they might as well have given the device no visible data -accuracy of step counting not as accurate as the One ( this may be a trend for Fitbit as the accuracy of the One is not as good as the Ultra). -no trigger when inactive for a period of time -difficult to fasten -takes up two USB ports on the computer: one for the charger and one for the dongle -takes a long time to charge, even if not fully depleted I assume the absence of basic functions available on the other devices must be a marketing ploy by Fitbit since this item costs the same as the other Fitbits without the functionality of those devices. There are a few things I like: -no need to find a place to attach it to clothing -somewhat waterproof (I have not tested this feature) -ability to change out the bands to different colors -not unattractive to wear,even with dress clothes and other jewelry -comfortable and unobtrusive-I often forget I am wearing it Because of the paucity of data it provides, and because none of it is available from looking directly at the device, I am still wearing my other Fitbit as well. Aside from the inconvenience of wearing two devices This creates more work as you can not have more than one device per account/email address. If you want all the data in one place you have to manually enter it under one account or the other. Sheesh! I have read reviews that say it over counts, and counts things like driving as steps. I have not had this problem; in fact mine seems to under count. I am wearing it on my nondominant arm. Reviews have complained about the short battery life, listed in the manual as approximately 5 days. I have charged mine at 5-6 days and it always has 4 bars (5 is the max). It does take a LONG time to charge though,and the manual warns of this: to charge from 4 bars to 5 takes well over an hour. I am not using the sleep function and Bluetooth data to my phone about 3-4 times most days which may help explain my longer battery life. While there are a couple of nice things about this device it is WAY overpriced for what it offers. It seems Fitbit created this more as a novelty than as a useful device like the original, Ultra, and One.

For me, I only wanted a way to keep better track of my activity and sleep, but I wasn't asking for perfection. The Flex does a good job, and I wouldn't wish it was any different. It may be slightly inaccurate, but I didn't need pinpoint accuracy. If you want to track every step, every calorie, every inch, then this product is not for you. However, if you want to become more aware of your daily movement, approximate how many calories you burn, and keep better track of your sleep, then this is perfect. I have found it to be perfect. I wanted a wristband, and the flex is small, unobtrusive, and comfortable. The wristband is flexible, and the clasp holds well. The device itself is amazingly tiny and light, and so far quite durable. It has withstood sweat, sunscreen, seawater, poolwater, the shower, shampoo, etc. Syncing with Fitbit.com is easy, and charging is also easy. I leave both the wireless dongle and the charging cable attached to my computer all the time. The website is easy to use, and adaptable. You can easily change your settings, track your food, input your weight, and modify your daily goals. The silent alarm is silent and effective, but the only way to enable or disable it is from the computer, which is a little annoying. The star of the show is Fitbit.com's integration with other websites. I have connected it to my MyFitnessPal account, and am constantly astonished at the seamlessness of the data sharing. Fitbit shares my activity and calories with MyFitnessPal, and MyFitnessPal shares my food and weight inputs with Fitbit, all without me lifting a finger. I could not be happier with this feature! The only thing I have found myself wishing was that there was a way to display the time on the Flex. Even though the screen with the lights is tiny, it could be readable, and I often wish that I knew what time it was, and was wearing a watch as well as the Flex. However, if adding this would make the Flex any larger, I wouldn't wish it. Right now it is anything but bulky, but I wear it on the inside of my wrist and it could easily begin to knock on things as I move my arm or use my hand. Overall, it is a great product for me. Could it be more accurate? Sure! Are the step counts sometimes off? Yes, it's on your arm, not your leg! Are the calories perfect? Come on, it doesn't have a heart rate monitor, what are you expecting? Right now it is pretty accurate, small, comfortable, easy to use, and cheap compared to the Nike Fuelband, more durable than the UP by Jawbone. I am interested to see whether they can make the Flex more accurate without sacrificing anything, but for now... I think it's perfect, and will continue to wear it until it dies.",

            "review_text": "I don't have time to write that many reviews but I have had both the Jawbone Up (v2) and I just recently purchased the FitBit Flex after the Jawbone just flat out stopped working. Since I spent time troubleshooting the jawbone and for the life of me and the assistance I got I never got it to work I decided to just flat out switch to another product. This gave me a means to stack the FitBit Flex against the Jawbone Up (v2). There happens to be a lot of reviews here already comparing the two but I just wanted to give my two cents on the areas of difference that I noticed from personal experience. FitBit Flex doesn't seem to be as accurate in steps tracking as the Jawbone Up for me, maybe not others. But lets say I am on riding a regular John Deer Lawnmower and spending 3+ hrs on it mowing our office property. The time spent turning the wheel and everything has been tracked as steps taken. I go from 6,000 steps before I start to over 10,000 steps, and I know for sure I didn't push mow this place... there may be some tweaking that I need to do, but in general the basic setup that it has you do didn't stop this from happening 3x so far. Otherwise it does detect me driving and does an ok job with I am actually push mowing my own lawn. Just in comparison to the aspect that they makers say they test these devices extensively and \"it knows\" when you are stepping or otherwise, may be accurate but not in my case nor the basic setup of the device. The other thing I have noticed in comparison is that the software is not as polished in some areas as the Jawbone Up was, but in some others areas it is better. It kind of depends on what you are wanting out of the stats. One area that it lacks and it has been mentioned previous to me is the Sleeping Feature. It just tells you how long you slept and doesn't know or tell you \"deep (rem) sleep\" vs \"light sleep\" it just tells you how long you were in deep sleep and the rest is how many times you were awake or active which is a combination of being in light sleep or actually tossing and turning and waking up. The data I do believe is there from the device for the software to determine more accurately, so maybe that is something that will be fixed in future releases of the software or maybe a combination with a firmware update. Functionality, and looks of the device I think is better. The Jawbone Up always get caught on something as I am getting dressed or otherwise, where the Flex is more like a watch and it better when you are typing on a keyboard or otherwise have your wrists laying flat on a desk, it feels more natural with the Flex. I like the indicator lights in comparison to really nothing other than one light that gives you different indications depending on what you have done to make it interact with you. I am still torn between the two for features, but as of right now I am keeping the FitBit Flex and will just await updates on features and upgrades. For tracking my sleep better I may have to look at a little more feature rich device as it is cause if anyone asks my wife she thinks I have some issues with trying to sleep or staying asleep as it is.",

They came out with a pink that I would love to have, but I don't need a whole new flex, just the band. The force would be great to have, but I don't think it would be worthwhile to spend $130 for one that does just a little more than what I already have. I did get great service when my band broke, they sent me a new one with no problems and that has held up for the past 3 months. I have had my fitbit flex for almost a week now and it has really helped me stay motivated to get fit. There are only a couple drawbacks that I have encountered. First, it can be somewhat challenging to get the flex latched onto the wrist, the clasp can be difficult. Second, I don't currently have a computer or phone compatible with the app needed to sync. I was using a chromebook, which meant I couldn't download the flex app, and my android phone doesn't have the bluetooth that is needed. I wound up borrowing a computer that I could download the app onto and have ordered one with the necessary bluetooth. Finally, and this just happened today, the website that the flex syncs to was down for a while, which frustrated me. It probably wouldn't have been a problem if I wasn't the type of person that wants to check my progress 20 times a day. Once I got past those problems, I have to admit, this product is amazing! I can track my sleep quality, exercise, use the app to monitor calories, and track progress toward exercise and weight loss goals. I mentioned that I constantly check my progress on the web, and you can actually use fitbit.com to do most of those things, but the great thing about the flex is that you don't have to log everything, it can keep track of your steps, exercise time and intensity, sleep, etc. for several days! I love to go for a run and then come home and see how many steps I took, how long I worked at which level of intensity, and how far I went. It is a great motivator! Update after almost one year: For some reason my flex quit working after 11 months (I may have been wearing it too tight and it needed room to \"breathe\") but when I went to fitbit.com and they sent a replacement immediately. I have already recommended it to several friends and we try to stay ahead of each other. I was lost without it while I waited for the replacement! As soon as arrived I had to go for a walk to get those steps logged!",

It does measure sleep but it's ability to determine whether or restless or awake isn't accurate. You can measure water consumption and your weight which is nice if you're trying to track or run metrics against it. It tries to auto calculate your active minutes but again it doesn't do a good job at this either. You can manually enter the metrics for this which is fine by me, but it brings the accuracy of what it does do automatically into question overall. You have to pay extra for additional reporting features too. Overall, the only feature I found the most useful was the silent alarm. It helps get me up in the morning when I don't want to wake up my partner and it tells me when my classes are finished. lol Very expensive alarm ;-) I think that if you buy this just be wary that it has a chance to stop working after the 30 day return policy. I'm going to see if this can be returned and use the money to buy something else to help me measure my activity.",

The other thing was how hard it was to get on my wrist -- mostly owing to the fact that I have pretty long fingernails. I was glad it was waterproof because it was hard to put on.

I gave the edge to the Fitbit Flex because I felt it offered more and I didn't like the look of the Jawbone. My wife was the first to really put the Flex to the test on her morning 3.5 mile walk pushing our daughter in a stroller. We both liked the wireless syncing but the steps counted and calculated distance were off. We decided to follow the online procedures to calculate the steps and the next day the measurements were closer but not exact. We attribute this to pushing the stroller and her arm is not swinging freely all the time. I really like the sleep tracking feature. I work shift work and it gives me a good picture of how much sleep I am getting when I'm working nights and when I'm working days. It also shows when I'm resless or the times that I get up during the night. The web interface and the android app are great FREE add-ons for an already great product. The Flex has definitely helped my wife and I make a more conscious effort to walk more. We had the Flex with us on our recent vacation and it was amazing to see how many miles we walked over a 5 day period. The negatives that we have noticed after 3 weeks is the count errs on the conservative side (this can be a positive too because you don't want a product that says you walked more than you actually did because that can lead to an inaccurate calorie burn). You can get false steps counted when scrubing the dishes or other activity that can fool the band into counting steps. Even though the band is waterproof, if you want to have a more accurate daily count, remove the band when doing the dishes. Amazon showed a 1-3 month back order but it only took 5 weeks for us to receive our Flex bands.",

            "review_text": "The fitbit concept is an excellent one for those of us who want to maximize our activity levels and calorie burns and want to understand how our sleep patterns affect our health and energy levels. The idea is to wear this device day and night, and each time you are near your computer (or smartphone in somecases), data is automatically uploaded through a bluetooth dongle. You can then log into your Fitbit dashboard and track various statistics over time. These would include steps/day, calories/day, sleep quality, food intake..etc. I thought it would be interesting to wear the device to understand what my work and leisure lifestyle is like (outside of my normal every other day running routine). Then on the days I run, I also wanted to compare my actual distances and steps with those recorded by the fitbit device. Alas, my conclusion is that this device is no more than a toy and users should not base a exercise and diet program on the data provided by it. Some serious issues crop up that cause me to believe that these devices have been either rushed into production or just have inherent flaws that make them inaccurate. Some examples: 1) I was looking forward to understanding my sleep patterns. The fitbit is supposed to record deep sleep, restless sleep and times awakened. Just before you go to sleep each night, you put the device into \"sleep mode\" to record this data. In my case I discovered that I have not slept 1 minute in the last 3 weeks. Fitbit support says this is a known problem they are working on. 2. Fitbit is overly generous in giving you credit for steps. The manufacturer claims that is because you will burn calories while doing other things, and the awarding of steps is their way of crediting you for those calories burned. But if the point is to take 10,000 steps per day, then one should be trying to meet that goal, not getting credit for just moving their arms. 3. The food intake log is primitive and the food database appears to be crowd-sourced from other fitbit users. You basically have to make up your own favorites and assign calories to them to get any reasonably accurate data. 4. The activity log is also primitive and crowd-sourced. My favorite search result is number of calories burned for \"sitting in squad car\". 5. Battery life - Fitbit claims users should get up to 9 days battery life between charges. In reality, I get know more than 36 hours which means I have no data for a full half day every other day. Pretty much ruins the concept of continuous tracking. 6. Warranty - Beware Amazonians - if you do not purchase the fitbit from fitbit.com, you do not get the 45 day money-back guarantee. All you get is a limited warranty for replacement, and the warranty terms on the web site do not give you any instructions on how to make a return under the limited warranty. 7. On-line support - Support is email only, or through the fitbit community. Responses can take several days. In 3 cases where I felt the product was not working correctly, support informed me that all were known problems that were being worked on in future releases. It wasn't clear if by \"future release\", they meant the Fitbit dashboard, or the device itself. All in all, I think I would wait another year before trying it out again. If there were a way to return it for a full refund, I would, but can't because I bought it through Amazon. That's adding insult to injury.",

I think I was cheated out of miles and miles over the past three years. I much prefer the wristband and it seems to better measure my mileage. The only complaint I have is the locking mechanism. I struggled with it for days, even my husband couldn't get the snaps to lock in place. The light blue band has never been clasped on, I've struggled with it for weeks and it will not snap in place. I wear the red band because I can put it on by my self (not easy). I wondered if others are having problems with the closure mechanism too? I'd prefer a sliding closure mechanism that is easy on/off than the snaps. The wristband fitbit also doesn't hold a charge as long as the clip-on fitbits. Other than that, I really really love it - everyone on our leaderboard has the wristband now.",

So many great features and it's easy to learn to use. If you want something to track your activity during the day- this works really well. Strength training you still need to enter as it will not pick up that well. It is geared for walking/running- so keep that in mind.

On my first day of use, I mistakenly thought that the lights would come on and stay on as I achieved new levels throughout the day but I quickly figured out that the light display requires a double tap. Not a big deal and much less distracting than lights that stay on constantly, but the pictures always show it with the lights lit up so that's what I expected.

Sometimes the Flex is only off by a few steps at a time, but overall it's off by 20% or more, which adds up to THOUSANDS of steps per day. The water resistance is great; no worries about submerging it in a tub or sink full of water. It's incredibly easy to set up and use; the sleep measure is fairly accurate given what it is, it syncs both with my PC and iPhone seamlessly and quickly, and I *love* the alarm feature, but that doesn't add up to the wasted time to manually log the missing info daily. Needless to say, it's on its way back. =(",

I was even swinging my left arm(one with flex on) in the store while I was walking around. I haven't found out the science of how it counts steps, its not by stepping alone and sometimes not counting when you swing your arms. Thank god for amazon's amazing return policy!!!

While I did not get a rash my band did start to tear after only a few months of what I would call really moderate activity and only once a week charging so I was not taking the unit in and out of the band a lot.

Moving to an urban area nearly doubled the amount of daily exercise I get, and I lost 10 pounds. Working from home is terrible for my health and I burn a small fraction of the calories.

I have it synced to MyFitnessPal so I can continue to use that app to track my calorie intake. I also really love how the Fitbit is able to track my sleep. I put it into sleep mode (which is super easy) and then I am able to look back and see how much sleep I am good and what quality it was. The silent alarm is also awesome! I can set it to wake me up and also to remind me when I need to be working-out.

I ordered the Fitbit Flex for him, hoping it might make things easier, and it has. It's waterproof, so he can wear it in the pool and the shower, it's fairly comfortable (he hates watches and jewelry, so wearing a band around his wrist was a little bit of an adjustment for him at first) but the benefit of having it outweighed any discomfort for him, and it's very easy to use. He hasn't taken it off since he got it, which is a *big* deal, and he's obsessed with checking it and seeing how he's doing throughout the day. He even found a way to get it into the lining of his karate uniform, which is a pretty big deal for him (he's working towards his black belt). All in all, this was a GREAT upgrade from the original Fitbit and much easier to wear and use for his lifestyle.",

            "review_text": "I purchased this Fitbit Flex in May 2013. I had to wait a month for delivery because I was a late comer to this item. As my title says it is a great motivator for working out and eating healthy. I synced it to my phone and track my progress all day long. I downloaded the MyFitnessPal app and it syncs with the Fitbit app. The combination of the two apps is a great snapshot of your fitness/eating progress. The sleep tracking is also pretty good. On the phone app it will say 15X awakened but when you look at your fitbit snapshot online it will break it down to 2X awakened and 13X restless. The silent alarm function is also very good. I comapred the step counter to another one I have a Virgin Healthmiles Gozone. I have the GoZone in my pocket and the Fitbit on the wrist. The Fitbit registered about 1000 more steps. The Fitbit is comfortable to wear. I personally wear it on my non dominant arm. Okay, now to the reason I only gave it 4 stars. My wrist strap ripped after 2.5 weeks of use. I wore it everyday and only took it off to wipe the water out of the Fitbit holder. It ripped at the clear plastic and rubber junction. The second reason is sleep mode. The Fitbit can be very temperamental going into sleep mode. There are some nights that I have to constantly tap to put it in sleep mode. Then there are times when it goes into sleep mode quite easily. One instance I can remember was when I clapped at a choir performance and it vibrated and went into sleep mode just from clapping. It happened three times during that concert. The third reason is sometimes the Fitbit app sometimes will not update. As I write this review I updated the Fitbit app on my phone and it just gives me the updating symbol. If I restart the phone it usually fixes it. All in all this is a great product. I liked it so much that I purchased a second one for my girlfriend. She loves it too.",

Easier to deal with than a pedometer, good at tracking sleep (I'm narcoleptic, so that's very helpful information for me, especially in appointments with my neurologist), good at tracking activity, interface reasonably good for letting me track food. But I liked the look of the Fitbit Flex better and ordered one of those that was backordered. When it arrived, my plan was to wear the two together for a week and decide at the end of the week which one I liked better and retire the other one. Within a day, I knew that the Up was bound for a drawer and Flex was staying on my wrist. It's far more comfortable for me, for one thing: Up has a pretty rigid top and bottom, but even the flexible sides move only so much, so you really always feel it. (I am an overweight woman but not obese, and I wore the largest Up band. Still definitely felt it all the time.) Flex is, well, flexible, everywhere except the top for about an inch across. Very comfortable, and I usually forget that I'm wearing it. Plus, I can't lie: I think that Flex is much prettier, and the slate color is my favorite grey-blue. Up was the color of a late-1980s PC and pretty ugly, IMO. Flex doesn't require removal from the wrist ever except charging, which is minutes at a time every eight or ten days (I'm saying that from memory; I didn't actually track how long I wore it before having to charge). (Both devices remind you on iOS or OSX with a little alert when your battery is going to need a charge in a couple of days. No idea what either does with Windows or other operating systems.) Flex transmits your data via Bluetooth using a tiny USB receiver plugged into your computer (I'm sure that there are other ways, such as to an iPad or iPhone, but I haven't looked that up) any time you're within 20 feet of the receiver. You can view the data using an app or on fitbit.com. Up requires removal from the wrist to sync and then removal of a little cap from one end to plug it into the headphone jack of your idevice. Odds were good that I'd have lost that little cap before long (I managed not to lose it during the month or so of using Up). Both require you to tell them when you're going to sleep. The signals for this are clearer on Up (a little moon-shaped LED shows up on it when you are in sleep mode and changes to a different shape when you wake it up; on Flex, the only visual interface is a series of lit-up dots, and you have to learn what the various patterns mean). But there aren't but so many signals to learn, so it's not difficult. And Flex's documentation is much better, simpler, and clearer than Up's, making it easier still for the new user to get used to sleep and wake and the other signals. The best thing about either device is the increased awareness of activity (or lack thereof). Both devices let you set goals and connect with other users, if that's your thing. There are lots more things to track using Flex, but I haven't had a chance to explore all of them yet. I expect to like it more as I explore it more.",

We will be checking to see how the warranty goes, what type of feedback we get, and will update this as we find out. new bands are a little expensive considering the material and the likeness to the silicon styled watches for $1.99.

The Flex is none of those things. First strike is that it doesn't very accurately measure your steps - kinda critical for a pedometer. Still, not so inaccurate as to be useless. Second strike is that the flex lasts, in my experience, about 3 days before needing recharged. Not awful, but not great when you have to pull it out of the band to charge. Third strike is the band. It cracks almost instantly when inserting or removing the flex. Total garbage. Bonus strikes in our metaphorical baseball game: 1. The fitbit often refuses to synch. A charming addition to an already tragically flawed product. 2. When you can synch, it often gets \"silent alarms\" stuck in \"synching\" mode. Don't want to be woken up at 6AM after the one time that you did? Tough noogies, because your alarm is still \"synching\", so you can't change it. 3. In the rare event you achieve connection with your fitbit, prepare for it to disappoint as it seems to be unable to synch multiple days of data at a time. I had high hopes for the flex. The ultra was great, the app ecosystem is wonderful, and it tied in nicely with our Aria and our Endomondo app. Unfortunately, it fails on nearly every measure of a healthcare appliance. Flaky, poor quality, and short battery life. Pass on this version. If you want a fitbit, get an ultra.",

First if I tend to sweat too much my Flex sometimes likes to stop responding and recording information. At first I thought I broke it, I discovered that putting it in the charging cable dock and hooking it up to the computer tends to \"wake\" it. This has happened three times now in the almost 2 weeks I've owned it. Second when I am working out on the elliptical it does not keep track of my step counts. Which makes no sense as I have my profile set to my stride length, and I have it set to my non dominant hand, etc. Lastly if I am shopping it's not keeping track of my steps unless I let my left arm swing while trying to control the cart with my right hand alone. I also noticed on a few occasions of pushing the shopping cart, it tends to cause my tracker to go into sleep mode on its own, I think this could be because of the vibration of the cart. According to the FAQ on the website it's supposed to track when you push a cart, but might be slightly lower because it's worn on your wrist. However. I can walk up and down every single aisle of a big box store, and the tracker doesn't track more than 100 steps during that time. Overall I feel it's a decent concept and I like my tracker. Just wish that it worked a tad bit better! I may update or add more information the longer I've had it.",

I purchased this when I realized I had lost my Ultra after walking to a friends house. The wristband design solves this issue and makes it very difficult to lose the product while wearing it. Its sleep function is much more user friendly than the Ultra. A few repeated taps causes it to enter sleep tracking mode. This is much simpler than the velcro wristband included with the ultra and requires hardly any thought. Let me address the concerns of some other reviewers. Unlike the ultra the flex relies on five led lights to indicate progress towards your daily goal. The Ultra relies on a small screen with a readout. This allows the Ultra to provide more information directly from the device, however, this information is limited and requires a sync to a computer to get more detailed info. The Flex is capable to syncing to a smart phone to provide real time data when desired. I found this much more convenient than the small screen on the Ultra. Also, some reviewer have complained that the wristband is difficult to close. After wearing the wristband practically 24/7 (with exceptions for swimming, showering, and charging) I can say that the wristband becomes much easier to get on and off with time, yet doesn't show any sign of wear or tear. I mentioned charging above. I have found that charging through the USB cable from completely dead to full takes less than the three hours listed in the instructions. The claim of five days of batter life seems accurate. As some reviewers have mentioned, there is no altimeter for stairs. Sorry to tell those Ultra lovers out there, but the altimeter on the ultra wasn't accurate. I tested it walking the twelve flights of stairs to my floor in my office building. Not once did it accurately record the correct number of floors. Really, the altimeter isn't a big loss. It was simple \"feature creep\" on the ultra. In summary, the Flex is a great product for someone looking to get in shape. If you are a smartphone user, I would highly recommend it. The function is simple, the wristband is slim (between a livestrong bracelet and a small watch), and it integrates well with apps like my fitness pal. I have been pleased with its performance. It encourages me to make small additions to my fitness (taking the stairs instead of the elevator and walking a slightly longer but more scenic rout home), which is one of the main motivations for wearing a pedometer.",

I originally loaded the app to my I-pad mini but found that I could also use it on my phone and it would update the information on both. I did see others complained about the clasp coming off so I decided to use the larger band and have had no problems. I like the sleep activity feature but did I feel that it wasn't reflecting the times I felt I woke up but when I switched it to \"sensitive\" I think it was more accurate. You do need to tap it several times at night to turn the sleep mode on and again in the morning it tell it you are awake but I find that no more difficult then setting my alarm each night and turning it off each morning. I also like how at the end of the week I receive an e-mail with a summary of the previous week.

I do like the steps, miles and calorie burn along with the food diary that keeps track of what I eat. Makes me more accountable for my food intake. Sleep pattern is easy to use. Turn it on when going to sleep and hit I'm awake when you wake up. You can also log it manually if you forget to set it.

Cons... well more points of note really. > I'm not quite sure how accurate the sleep mode is. There were some.. \"Nocturnal activities\" I was woken up for after I set it to sleep mode which may account for the inaccuracies. I will update this in a later review. > If you want to sync directly to your phone or tablet make sure you know which devices are capable. I was well aware that my phone (Samsung Galaxy S2) and my table (Surface RT) would not sync. As I plan to replace my phone with the S4 which is capable, I am not that upset. I simply sync with my PC when I return home. To those that might complain about the supported phone sync issue there is a very good reason for this. May I suggest you research what (BLE) Bluetooth 4.0 Low energy protocol is. As for the lack of support with the Surface RT... well I blame fitbit on this one, RT is app driven so the setup program will not run on this OS. > In case you do not know, this is not a heart rate monitor. No one ever said it was. > In an aerobic exercise eg. P90X program it will track some movement but obviously not all of your caloric burn will be accounted for. If that is what you are looking for invest in a heart rate monitor. ...... ( See statement above ) More to come...",

Because of the success I felt with the clip-on tracker, I was ready to upgrade to the flex. If you are looking for a pedometer that you can wear on your wrist, and which syncs to your phone via bluetooth, this works. My only real complaint are that steps do not recorded as accurately as the other fitbit pedometers -- simply tapping my hand or waving will alter the number of steps taken. I use the large wristband provided with the flex, but have had the clasp snap off unexpectedly several times. I keep the wristband connected at a comfortable length; it is not tight around my wrist which could explain the problem. I think this must be a problem others have had, because fitbit sells replacement clasps. The flex also does not measure the number of stairs taken; it wasn't until I received the device that I learned of this and then a week later the fitbit force was released which includes this feature, along with a clock, and call details from your mobile phone. If you are looking for accurate measurements, I would recommend the fitbit one, but if you are comfortable with a little less accuracy and prefer a wearable device I would probably suggest spending a little more and opting for the newer fitbit force.",

Also, I don't use the food function or the water consumed function. I don't like being such a monitoring freak when I'm trying to drop weight. I appreciate the silent alarm that wakes me with vibration. It's less jarring than an audible alarm and doesn't usually wake my bed partner. I wish it would accurately measure laps while swimming and other movements, but it doesn't have that capability. Seems like it wouldn't be that hard to add it to the software since swimming is a fairly unique motion with the arms/hands, but. It is what it is. Will I get another one if this one dies? Probably not. It's kind of a novelty and hasn't really helped me with my goals. Kind of just a fun little toy while it lasts.",

I really appreciate the weekly updates and app layout too. It has helped me lose 10 lbs so far so I deem it well worth the money. My only other complaint that I think will be addressed with time is the food database. A lot of the free food tracker apps (like MyFitnessPal) have a bigger food database that covers a lot more restaurants and food types. If you eat ethnic food, you'll likely not find it listed or listed accurately with the FitBit database. But this issue will likely be remedied in the coming months as more people use it. Oh, and those who get frustrated like me trying to switch your fitbit into the sleep function. You have to hold your wrist tight to your body to keep the fitbit still (if it's a little loose on your wrist it's near impossible to switch) and then tap, tap, tap.

Like others, I do think it reads a bit high, though I have tweaked the settings and wear position so it's closer to being accurate. My biggest gripe about it is that the \"low battery\" warning comes up pretty suddenly and the iPhone app doesn't seem to read this as accurately as it should. As the battery life is shorter on the Flex than the One, this sometimes means that it's not always convenient to charge it when tha's needed. FitBit support made some suggestions for prolonging the battery life that have helped, but in some cases, that's meant interacting directly less with device and more with the iPhone app. My other issue is that the \"go to sleep/wake up\" taps on the device just don't seem to work as effectively as they should, so I've taken to just telling the iPhone app when I go to sleep/wake up, and that's mostly doing the job for me. I wish the Flex had maintained more of the One's features, like the on-device battery display, clock, and dynamic activity meter. On the other hand, I can wear the Flex in the shower (though a lot of water gets inside the device compartment on the wristband, and you really need to clean that out every couple of days with a cotton swab). I guess if I had to name the thing that annoys me most about the Flex, it's the battery life/short notice for charging. I realize that the smaller device size means a smaller battery, but I think it should be able to go a week between charges, and this thing just can't -- 5-6 days is about it.",

            "review_text": "The FitBit is an excellent, single-purpose product. If you want to know whether you've walked 10,000 steps in a day, it's a great product. If you have an iPhone or an Android phone that FitBit works with, then your phone regularly updates your stats. If you use just one Windows or Mac computer through the day, then you can update through that. The FitBit website and Android software give excellent statistics on how much and when you walked. It also estimates calories burned, lets you record your meals, and gives other information. Here are some weaknesses: 1. Almost everything goes through FitBit's Internet server. If that server goes down, then your FitBit won't be very useful. 2. I found it difficult to snap on the wristband; it took me about ten minutes. Perhaps this will get better with time. 3. Even if your Android device has Bluetooth 4.0, synchronization doesn't work with devices that FitBit doesn't list on their website. So, though I can install the Android software on my Nexus 7 (2013), I can't synchronize through it. (I'm lucky that I have a cell phone that it does synchronize with.) UPDATE: After several weeks, I'm still using my FitBit and its website. It still works to get me more active. Snapping on the wristband has become much easier with time. FitBit has one more advantage: it integrates with other websites. My wife, who has her own FitBit, uses MyFitnessPal for its excellent calorie counter. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.",

I've used this device for over a year and the charger started to NOT DISPLAY THE DOTS THAT IT'S CHARGING while I have the device sitting on the charger mount. I fiddled with it and found that I had to hold fitbit tightly to the charger with a band or tape in order to charge. This has been working until a couple of months ago... Now, it won't charge even if I hold the device. I found out after trying so many different solutions is that I have to mount it in a certain angle (NOT STRAIGHT) for it to charge. I thought my charger was faulty so I bought a cheap replacement just to try. Same thing happened. I wish I could replace mine with a non faulty unit, but I'm afraid the same thing will happen.",

Also, the website has a fairly thorough list of foods for when you track your diet. The battery life lasts about a week (and charges fully in under an hour), and if the battery gets run down too far you get notified on the site, emailed and texted to remind you to charge up. I've heard some reviewers mention that they had issues snapping the band closed, but I never had any difficulties with it. The flex also gives you a great feeling of accomplishment when you hit 10,000 steps in a day by vibrating and flashing the lights (you also get texted and emailed when you hit other milestones, such as walking 15,000 steps in a day, walking 50 miles total, etc.) I've had my flex almost 2 months and I love it.

Within a day of wearing my flex, the clasp kept coming undone. I made sure to 'click' it into place, but it would still come loose. It even came loose while sleeping a couple times. I've read raters blame users for the clasp coming undone, but I took extra special care to make sure it was secure. It's still had a habit of coming undone. This is a huge negative because I really don't have the time to constantly fiddle with the clasp to make sure it's secure when it frequently comes undone. The product is supposed to be designed encourage activity. Today, I was a rare day where I was able to run errands without my little one. I loved the product because it hardly notice that it's there while I'm using it, but this time, I wish I noticed it more. Somewhere between errands, the clasp came undone and the flex fell off.

Plus if you read the help pages you will learn that it only tracks hand movement, so if you have your hand on the cart at the grocery store or on the rails of your treadmill it may not count your steps.

The social aspect of it is interesting - being able to cheer and taunt your friends that also use Fitbit. That said, it definitely isn't perfect - sometimes I notice it count more steps than I'm taking, sometimes it counts less (maybe the logic is that it evens out?) and the sleep accuracy varies. Bottom-line is that it definitely helps encourage you to walk - which is good for your health and that's good no matter what the details.

I can certainly tell the difference in my sleep quality on the nights my cat decides to sleep with me! I have had no issues so far with any of the functions, so hopefully that will continue to be the case. I use a stationary bike and have found that if I tape the device (or tie it with a twist-tie) around my ankle it will count my pedal turns as steps, although it does not seem to add those steps into the miles traveled calculation. (Which is okay with me, as it is not advertised to track biking activity anyway). I have also owned a Striiv pedometer for over a year and love it also, for different reasons. Except for tracking steps, the Striiv does different things in different ways than the Fitbit Flex and is a totally different product concept, so to compare them as to which is \"better\" would be unfair to both products. They are both excellent in my opinion. Anyway... if you are thinking of purchasing a Fitbit Flex, I think you will love it! Oh, except maybe for the backorder time which still seems to be 4 to 6 weeks, and it was also the same if trying to order from the Fitbit website. My order on Amazon was 4 weeks to delivery, but I'm glad I waited it out. p.s. Some reviewers have mentioned that the band is hard to fasten, and it is... but I have found that if I line up the fasteners and just push them hard against the back of my wrist with my thumb that it is much easier than trying to squeeze them shut with your thumb and first finger as stated in the instructions.

I was worried that all my hand movements would effect the readings but they don't seem to set it off my much. I love tracking my steps and even better for me is the sleep log. It tells me how many hours I actually slept and how many times I woke up within the night. Some of my concerns when debating over this tracker verses others were the display, accuracy and water proof. So accuracy I covered earlier, that seems right on. Not having a fully digital display was different. They did make up for it in lights. When you get close to your goal the indicator lights light up. If you are behind in the day it will have a special light display as if to say hurry up. I found that didn't even bother me as much as I thought it would. And if that's a concern you can download it to your phone to display your progress. The next is waterproof- which it is! I went to the water park with it and it held up great! I would say go for it! It's so much fun to see how much I walk and what times I walk the most. I also love love love the sleep log!! 5 stars for me!

I wish it had a clock and step counter rather than just the dots, but I knew what I was getting when I bought it. I originally purchased it because the company I work for started a Wellness program where I get points for the steps I walk. It meets my needs for that. Definitely worth what I paid and very pleased.",

And by logging/journaling, particularly food, I have started seeing that on days I felt like I had eaten lightly and healthy, the calories for this snack or that extra helping of something adds up really quick. Cons that keep me from giving it 5 stars: - doesn't detect/track heart rate - you have to use something else and then log it - doesn't seem to recognize intensity of effort for recumbent exercise bikes - water does get into the band cavity where the Fitbit tracker is inserted, but when I'm logging (easier on computer if you're adding new foods), I take the opportunity to remove the fitbit tracker to charge it and use a Q-tip to clean out the cavity. Overall, I love it! Very worthwhile investment in my health.",

Cons: The Charger / Charging system SUCKS majorly .. it is worse than bad. It's so bad I'll probably never recommend or buy this again. The problem is it that no matter how much you clean the contacts and play with the \"fitting' in the charger adapter it will often appear like it's charging but when you walk away and return the next morning it failed to charge.

You can track your exercise--sort of. But I spent an hour lifting weights--and that isn't under any of the icons like walking, running swimming etc. Yes, you can count your steps--but my husband and I both question the accuracy.

The best part about the fitbit is probably the social aspects on the site. I'm a competitive person. I like that you can add friends who also have one and compete.

Other days, a bit behind. So then, I will force myself to take that walk or other aerobic exercise. Once I do, my head starts to clear and then I generally feel better. Without the dashboard, I would have a real hard time keeping up with my goals. Same goes with my sleep. When my sleep shows up on the dashboard, it sends a strong reminder. To stick to my sleep schedule. Also Fitbit shows how many times I awake or am restless each night. Good information. What is missing? It seems that Fitbit primarily measures arm motion. As such, it kind of guesstimates how many steps you are taking. For my purposes, a ball park estimate is enough. Finally, does not monitor heart rate. (Silly, I thought that it would.) If Fitbit could also measure heart rate, then it would be several times more valuable. I have high hopes that Fitbit will be able to add heart monitoring as simple as they have made activity measurement.",

I put it on, went to sleep, the next morning it was completely depleted again. So again i put it on charged and took it off half a day later when it showed full charge. It synced fine and showed full battery on my phone app - yet again overnight it completely depleted the charge. Needless to say into the trashcan it went.

The sleep function is useless as it is telling me everytime that I woke up 13 times...as everytime u move from one side to the other it registers that you wake up...so I don't see it relevant.

It is inherently inaccurate. there is no way to input the length of your step, and the calorie consumption calculation differs from others I consider more accurate 2. it significantly over counts on some occasions and under counts on other occasions. I have counted stops with my pedometer and find that it is rarely off more than a few steps over s specific distance whereas the Flex rarely matches the count 3. it is extremely difficult to fasten the catch on the bracelet.

I find the Flex to be as easy to use as the Fitbit One, and I like the fact that it stays on my wrist. The only negative issue I have with it is that I can't look at it and see my step count. I can use an android app to view my step total, but I don't use my cell phone while at work and usually have to wait until after work to see where I'm at in terms of reaching my goal.

Unfortunately that version had a problem with crashing when try to enter food items on the iOS device. The next week they issued the new revision that seems to have corrected that issues. As of now everything is working as expected. The sleep monitoring unit works very well. The extreme database for food and drink items makes keeping track of caloric intake straight forward and the ability to input data for non-database items easy. The ability to log regular exercise such as walking and up/down stairs as ell as extreme exercise such as jogging easy also. the unit seems to be a little short on the battery power between charges (3-4days), that however, is very subjective since there is really no way to track usage, entry etc. data. But whatever, not a big issue. Really a very useful and accurate dieting and exercise monitoring device and waterproof as well. Would highly recommend unit as it will keep you on target. PS.

What needs improvement: 1- accuracy of steps taken is questionable 2- poor sleep accuracy 3- no bike tracking. When riding a bike for 50 miles shows 26,000 steps one day and 19,000 the next day when the rout was the same. I signed up for the expanded web reports and this is a beneficial feature. Although, you will have to manually put in the other vitals (blood pressure, heart rate, etc.). The weekly reports are good an you can compare by day, week or month. You can try the app and create an account with Fitbit without a Fitbit product. Try it before you buy the unit as I did. The good: Allows easy tracking, week to week to day to day tracking, and food/cals intake but you need to stay committed to the daily updates. Overall I have lost about 14lbs since I purchased it and installed the app which is about 5 lbs per month. Im pleased with my progress but it has taken work and improving the quality of food an reducing the intake with the walking/exercise. I would rate this higher if the 3 items listed in the needs improvement paragraph were addressed through a firmware update etc.",

LOTS of people complain about trouble getting the band to clasp properly, but it is not an issue if you take your time and practice getting it lined up right. It is light and comfortable - you can easily forget you are wearing it. Sleep monitoring is a breeze and pretty accurate as well. I have used this to track what I eat and motivate me to exercise more as a path to lose a specific amount of weight - it's not magic, but if you have the will and resolve to do this, the tracker and software help you plan and stay engaged in the process. It's so rewarding to follow the plan and see your results. The tracker gives real-time feedback but must by synced up to allow you to track progress on-line.

Third, the Fitbit Dashboard and Log put all the important metrics right in one place - steps, sleep, calorie counting, food log and even a journal.

Fourth, I love the buzzer, progress-tracking lights, email alert when the battery is low, silent morning wake-up alarm and the general coolness of how it looks. Finally, it's one of the only ways to track the walking I do on my treadmill desk - averaging 1.0 to 1.5 mph. I can keep that pace up for hours while I work on the computer, talk on the phone and manage my business. This has accelerated my weight loss, fitness and general sense of well-being immensely.

It has such a wide range of foods in the food logging bank that I didn't sign up for point tracking with weight watchers. It saves me the $20 a month which is always a bonus! Don't hesitate.

Good things: Very Light Battery last for 5 days as promised Easy to use (only 2 kind of taps needed) Easy to upload information Nice web dashboard in fitbit.com which allows you to enter more info mannualy. What you eat, water quantity you drink, diet plan and activities, weight, % of body fat. Things to improve and think before you buy: It took 4 weeks for me to receive the product. Lead time is awful. Bracelet wears really easy. Mine is already decolored. So you might want to buy the additional set of bracelets. App for Android devices can only be donwloaded if you are in USA, or in a short list of countries. I had to go to USA to download the app to my cell phone. Does not track heartrate. One must in these kind of devices. Should track other features atomatically. Water you drank, etc. Can only be charched pluged in to the computer. There is no outlet connector. This is my first fitbit device, and overall is a good product. I hope next generation include some of the things I expected.",

I never wore the product in water and I slept with it on for a couple of days, that's it. Yet four months later the strap broke. It comes with 2 straps male/female. Fortunately I was able to snugly fit the smaller one around my wrist. Unfortunately it did not matter because a month later it stopped charging. It lights up if I put pressure on it, but without the pressure it will not charge. Strapping the fitbit on isn't a simple process either. It just takes the perfect alignment to get on and it did snapped off while I was walking. I was lucky I saw it detach, otherwise I would have lost it.

It goes into sleep mode from the vibration of driving or when I am pushing a wheelchair which I do everyday at work. Also i you wear it in the shower since it is supposed to be water resistant. Water will get trapped inside the band and needs to be dried and aired out. It happen if your washing your hands as well so it's not just the shower. Another thing I don't like is it does not count stairs like advertised. It counts as a regular walking step. Unless you are changing pressure by climbing stairs to a very high height it will not calculate a stair. I do like the product but I wouldn't recommend it if you work with your hands a lot such as hair dresser or someone that does anything outdoors.

This didn't really bother me since in my opinion it was still a vigorous activity. It's interesting to see when it says you are having restless sleep and when you are awake. Again, this is not perfect, and you have to remember to turn the sleep setting off and on to begin with, but it is a helpful tool. Setting up this product was a bit of a hassle. My computer wouldn't recognize it. It turned out that I had a faulty piece. Fitbit replaced it with no hassle after a quick trouble shoot. However, then I had issues with my computer interfering with the new product. Again, after some troubleshooting, the issue was resolved. Then the sleep tracking wasn't displayed properly on the website. This was also corrected with some troubleshooting. Unfortunately, their customer service is a bit slow, so most times that I contacted them, I had to wait several days for a response. I am rating this a 3 more so for the initial issues with the device and the wait time with customer service.

Perhaps three stars is unfair, but I can't really say I like it or love it, so three stars it is.",

Amazon is no help (sadly, the amount of money I spend here) and the FitBit site is about worthless. Save your money, this is an official POS! UPDATE! Fitbit was kind enough to respond to this negative review so I followed their advice, it took them 10 days to respond to me and all I got was \"Thank you\" and \"we will pass your suggestions on to our engineering team\" not a word about a warranty or any indication they are inclined to help. I stand with my original statement and this company should be ashamed. If you are thinking of throwing your money away, find a charity, at least you will feel better.",

I also practically live in the pool (lifeguarding, teaching swim lessons, teaching lifeguarding, and swimming); the Fitbit Flex is not rated for submersion in water (despite very vague opposing sides on the matter!). Mine bit the dust after being in the water, and I upgraded to a Garmin Vivofit that so far - I like a lot better.",

At night, I am able to track the amount of sleep and my restlessness. After a few weeks, you start understanding your sleeping patterns and you try to make adjustments to improve your slumber. I suppose these devices are simply first generation, and soon, Apple will come out with its iWatch concept. I'm looking forward to having more features on these devices, but for now, this does the trick. Battery has a really long life, usually needing a recharge after about 5 days. If you charge it intermittently, you never really run out of battery.",

It has been such an education seeing my sleep patterns versus my performance during the day. I have recommended it to my running friends and two others have theirs on the way. Update: I would definately get a different band that latches like a watch band. I lost mine during a 5k race. Fitbit sent me a neat app to try and locate it. But no luck. So they sent me a new one for free since I was within the warranty period. I was so heartbroken when I lost it but they were wonderful to work with to get me going again!.",

The syncing problem, coupled with the total \"meh\" feeling about the app has forced me to return it and not look back. I'm waiting on future efforts from other companies before I take the plunge into wearable fitness products. Also, popping the damn little fob in and out of the unit is a pain in the rear that should be remedied for future models (Wireless charging and syncing, anybody?) Don't recommend at this current evolution of tech. I'd say wait, or save some $$ and get the smaller fitbit that clamps onto your lapel.",

Sleep is trackable which I find very interesting. It shows how long you sleep, when you were restless or awake and it seems fairly accurate. You can see graphs of how you're doing on the website and app. I integrated the Flex with my Lose It program and that works seamlessly. The Flex battery lasts a little over five days. Water can collect in the capsule where the tracker goes but I'm not finding that to be a real problem. I just wipe it out with an antiseptic wipe. I like the flexibility of being able to order other bands in different colors. I bought the Flex to help me get motivated to move more. It works for me.",

The pewter silver buckle/stud won't stay flush on the base without contortion or a partner to help you with it(similar to a woman's necklace) anyway, the good: inspires her to walk/move more in almost a competitive nature, I don't mind that part, great! the bad: seems expensive for just a basic device and simple program.
