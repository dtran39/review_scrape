            "review_text": "Pros: The unit is lightweight and easy to move. It has a variety of included attachments to tackle almost all jobs around the home. One nice feature is the adjustable spray tip on the wide-angle wand. The unit has a lot of power for an electrical pressure washer -- more than enough to clean driveways, decks, grills, mowers, etc. Cons: As mentioned in many other reviews, the plastic hose adapter leaks water, right in the middle where the two washers meet. The leaking is so bad as to make the unit unusable, unless you enjoy being sprayed with a torrent of water while you work. The solution: go down to your local hardware store and buy a brass male-to-male hose adapter for 8 bucks. Now you are in business. The high-pressure hose that runs from the unit to the spray-gun is made from a stiff plastic that tangles easily and is hard to manage as you move around. I am currently researching buying an after-market hose made from high quality rubber to avoid this problem. Also, don't bother storing the hose using the built-in reel. It is fussy work trying to get the hose on and off, and bending the hose in tight circles makes it that much easier to tangle when you use it. Simply coil the hose loosely and drop it around the top of the handle. This will save you lots of time. Final thoughts: This unit provides a good value among other electric pressure washers, if you don't mind upgrading the hose adapter and dealing with a slightly annoying hose.",

            "review_text": "The pressure washer does its job beautifully. It has a really long electric cord which was one of the requirements for me since I didn't want to mess with extension cords. The hose is actually pretty long too, so you don't have to drag the pressure washer around when you wash your car for example. Just set it in one place and the length of the hose will be enough reach all around. The pressure washer comes with 2 wands. One has a rotating tip and the other one has a tip that can be adjusted for different spray angles so you don't really need to buy any extra tips. It also has a bottle for cleaning chemicals. All accessories, electric cord and hose have their place right on the unit and they fit quiet nicely. Don't forget, it has 1900 PSI which is really pretty high pressure for non-commercial pressure washers. I don't know what's inside the unit, but it just feels sturdy and solid. I don't usually write reviews but what made me do it is AR North America's customer service. After testing the unit, I ordered an extra accessory from them directly (flat surface cleaner to clean cement surfaces). They have phone #'s and email addresses of their entire staff listed on their web side, so I asked few questions which were answered immediately. So I placed my order and couple of days later they informed me that the part I ordered was on back-order, so they offered to refund the money if I didn't feel like waiting. You know, usually companies will make you wait even if it's couple of weeks. I asked them how long I'd have to wait and they told me about a week which wasn't a big deal for me at all, so I was prepared to wait. The next day I received another email from them saying that they would send me a $90 surface cleaner instead of $30 one I had ordered...get this... at no extra charge. I buy stuff on-line very often and I have never seen anything like that before. Great product, great customer service. It's very comforting to know that a company stands behind their product in case you need it and most importantly, easily accessible.",

            "review_header": "AR383 Blue Clean Works Great!", 
            "review_text": "Works Great, No Leaks! Whatever you have read up to this point or after this point (10/20/11) forget it, pay it no mind... This puppy does the job! In all fairness to the negative reviews, I believe the product presently being sold now, right here on Amazon, may have gone through some upgrades. I put this unit to the test right out of the box and there were absolutely no leaks... not one drop... BONE DRY! I think it is largely to do with a newly included part that the \"leak issue\" stated in many of the comments, has been eliminated and no longer exists. Another stated issue that no longer exists is the difficulty to put this Blue Wonder together... There are five screws: 4 to put the attachment holder on the back of the unit and 1 screw to attach a plastic piece that assists in holding the electrical cord to wrap around the attachment holder. Maybe with previously models, the handle and the pressure hose reel (which is only for storage) had to be attached (I don't know) but there are presently no other parts to attach than what I have mentioned. The problem with the directions is that they now include an insert telling you about the new (leak-free) part included but the old part (which is no longer included) is still referenced in the main direction booklet. Although, when I called the toll-free number, which is clearly marked on the box lid and on another insert included with the directions, I immediately got a person on the phone that was not only pleasant but helpful too. They explained that this new part is included and answered all of my questions as to the negative complaints that I had read on Amazon (another reported complaint about getting a human on the phone that does not exist). In fact, I called twice and got another person who was also pleasant and helpful because I forget to ask the previous person about the lance removal issue that is also mentioned in the comments. If you don't push the lance into the spring-loaded insert opening on the end of the gun-handle and then twist it, the lance will just keep turning around and around, and it won't come out. I must admit, when I tried to remove the lance after inserting it but before powering the unit up and taking it out for a test, it was confusing... but when the pressure washer was on and the safety lock on the handle was in-gauged, the lance came out without issue with a push inward and a turned to get it out. I myself found the hose storage wheel not helpful because the pressure hose had a mind of its own and it did not want to go on the wheel without a fight. Also, the rubber protector on the end of this hose kept hitting the unit at the top and bottom position when winding it, which slowed down the process. I might only use this storage wheel for winter storage... I much prefer wrapping both the power cord and the pressure hose (one at a time) around may hand and elbow to wind them in a circle and then lasso them over the pressure washer handle which holds both cord and hose very well. I agonized over this purchase because most of the negative comments had the same complaints threaded through each negative review. I thought to myself, if these people don't know each other (which they don't) how then could each negative comment have the same or similar issues mentioned in each review. So I bought and un-bought this product in my head many times until one day I just closed my eyes and took the plunge in spite of it all. I believe, for me, it was the price, the 1900 psi and the reputable manufacturer of the pump that push me over the edge to buy this product and the fact that I knew Amazon would stand behind it and take it back (no questions asked) if I had an issue. The biggest change I made to my purchase process, was to test and use the product the day it arrived so it didn't sit here unboxed waiting to be opened months later only to find that I was past the return date without ever powering it up once. Let's see... have I left anything out... Oh yea, IT WORKS! I will try to make a video so you can see for yourself that it works. I hope this is helpful and addresses any negative comment you may have read. P.S. The threads on the AR383 are metric so if you purchase an American threaded part and attach it to the AR383, it WILL leak.",

The unit arrived in 2 days in perfect condition, we unpacked it and had it assembled in about 10 minutes without any problem. I had read in some reviews that the connector for the garden hose leaked, so I was anticipation having to deal with that, but to my pleasant surprise it did not and has not leaked even a drop! Well we fired it up and this little machine really preformed great right from the start and all I had to do was get the hang of it. My wife and I have been using it for the last two days on our fence and it is making an old dirty fence look like new again. So easy to use that I can't get my wife to put it down.... The only thing my wife was wishing that the trigger would lock so she did not have to hole it constantly, so I just got a zip tie and tied it around the trigger and it works perfectly and to release the trigger just slide the zip tie down.... So bottom line is yes I would not hesitate for one second to recommend this to anyone.",

Also, most sites rounded the flow rate down to 1.5gpm - the manual actually states it flows 1.58gpm max (which is closer to the 1.6gpm rating of the AR390). The manufacturer page is below: [...] I used mine for 3 hours straight the other day and it worked exceptionally. The narrow stream was powerful enough to actually remove old rust stains on our concrete walkway from the iron rail ... Be careful though, because it was actually powerful enough to remove (read, create and remove) some loose areas of concrete as well... I used the turbo nozzle for the majority of my patio cleaning project and it worked great, then I switched to the regular spray nozzle, set it to narrow and blasted off the rust stains and black Rustoleum spray paint that had gotten embedded into the concrete during touch ups of the rail. I've uploaded a shot from when I first received it and was just testing it out. That's more than 4 years of embedded crap on the patio, not just surface gunk! Thus far I've pressure washed the entire patio/entry steps and walkway, some siding and my wife's car! This thing's addictive!",

            "review_text": "It's been 3 months since I purchased the AR383. I've been using it exclusively with the AR Foam Cannon for my weekly car washes. It looks like the saying \"you get what you pay for\" holds true when it comes to presser washers. For the first month everything worked very well. I wasn't a fan of the build quality, but what do you expect for a $150 pressure washer, right? The weakest link to the unit is the hose. An optional rubber hose would have really made things easier. The included hose is very rigid and makes it a pain to either wrap or unwind. As others have noted, the wind up mechanism is only used for storage (don't let the photo fool you). The first issue I encountered was leaking. The rubber washer at the end which connects to the spray gun breaks down very easily. Once it starts to break down you'll have a terrible leak. At first I lived with the water spraying down my leg, but eventually it impacted performance. Every 15 seconds the motor would rev up. I fixed this with some aftermarket rubber washers (they look like little donuts) from home depot. The unit worked well for another 4 weeks, but now it's developed another problem. The washer at the other end of the hose (connects to unit) is now shredded up. Also the cheap plastic connector for the hose is developing issues. I may try replacing that with an all metal hook up and forget the filter like others have mentioned. My recommendation is that you always leave the hose connected to your gun and the unit itself. If AR Blue just offered a standard rubber hose and normal connectors I'm sure this unit would be great. From a performance standpoint it delivers above and beyond my expectations. However, it's always a toss up whether I can use it so I couldn't recommend it.",

            "review_text": "This is the second AR pressure washer I have purchased. I owned the AR Blue Clean hand held unit previously for a mobile cleaning service I operate. It was a great unit until I left it in the back of my truck overnight last winter and it froze. (Stupid I know, but I live in Arizona!) In the six months I owned it I was completely impressed with it's function but not with the convenience of storage to usage and back to storage. It had great power for the size and quick response when you squeezed the trigger. The AR383 is awesome. More power for more uses. Extremely light weight and compact. Great price (especially with A-Prime)! I use the \"Hose\" reel to wrap the power cord since I only need about 10 ft of power cord at any given time. If you wrap the High Pressure Hose on the reel you will have many headaches getting it straightened out for usage, and it does not wind the hose while attached to the unit anyway. I simply remove the wands from the high pressure hose, place the wands in their holders and coil the high pressure hose to about 8 - 10 inches in diameter and drape it behind the wands on the back of the washer. This is faster and more convenient than the reel anyway. Leaks? I have no problems. Take your time with assembly (which is very minimal). Be sure to thread the hose connections properly and do not CROSS THREAD the inlet/outlets. Use a little Vasoline on the inlet and outlet hose threads. This will stop any small leaks and will allow you to remove hoses easily if needed. I use quick connect adapters as well. No water Pressure / Will not pump? Make sure you let your inlet water hose run for a minute to be sure all air is out of the hose BEFORE you attach it to the Pressure Washer so you're getting water right to the unit. If you don't do this you could burn up the pump. You may also squeeze the wand trigger a few times after turning the washer on to allow flow through the washer then release the trigger and it will build the proper pressure. I operate from a storage tank with no pump and have never had an issue with this washer. Make sure you have water to the unit BEFORE you turn it on. I would encourage anyone interested in this product to ignore any review under 4 stars. OK, sometimes we get a lemon, but I truly believe most problematic issues are due to improper OWNER assembly or improper OWNER usage. AR could not possibly make this product any simpler to use. The design and engineering of this unit are about as good as it gets. I use this unit almost every day, way more than most ever will, and I have had ZERO issues. Have used units twice the size and weight and they do not even come close. This unit should handle any cleaning needs that any average consumer should encounter. (And, NO, I don't work for AR North America :-)) *** UPDATE: 7/19/2012 *** Just purchased my second AR383 - Great Machine, but a few changes have been made. *** *** Definately purchase new brass connections for the washer's water inlet. You could get away with the old plastic connection on previous models, but the new disign will never hold up. It looks fancy with a see through case and filter, but is very flimsy for major water connection. I took the old filter from inside the inlet housing on my old washer and transferred it to the new one and then installed the brass connectors. (you will not have this option, but as long as your water source is your hose at the house you should be OK. Run your hose a little before connecting to the washer to get rid of any sediment or debris settled in the hose. *** The connection for the pressure hose is now the same as most other washer or hose brands. AR includes an adaptor now in case you run into an odd size replacement pressure hose. If you need to replace the pressure hose, suck it up and by the entire hose / wand assembly from AR. A little more money, but it works best with this washer. *** Wrap your pressure hose with heavy electrical tape or some Gorilla Tape and it will last 5 times longer. The smallest nick in the pressure hose and that's it. Replace it. I have been whacked in the face when a pressure hose failed, and trust me, it was like a right cross. I worked out the amout of hours I used this washer and formulated a lifespan for normal use. If you used this washer for 3 hours a month, 12 months a year, you would have to use it for 15 years to put the same amount of hours on this washer that I have since purchased. Not too bad for a non-commercial washer. Still five stars from my point of view. *** See my photos.",

I read the reviews and was a little wary of buying this because of the number on Amazon that had problems (10% of reviews gave 1 star) but since so many had 4 and 5 star rating I decided to give it a shot. I have owned an electric pressure washer before and it had worked well for a couple of uses then began leaking. A replacement part was received but after using once, the same thing happened and I gave up. I decided to cut my losses this time and return it before the return period was up just in case the same thing happened. I assembled the unit carefully following the owners manual. The first time I used it, everything was great-no leaks like many others had experienced. I did try to use a heavy extension cord and had to find a closer outlet to get enough power but with the cord it was fine. The turbo nozzle was not of much use unless you wanted to cut into something but the adjustable one worked well cleaning a very dirty concrete sidewalk and also a wooden porch. Drained everything according to the directions and put away. I am glad I did not write my review immediately. Two weeks later when I went to use it again, it worked well again for about 10 minutes. Then I noticed that the pressure was not as high as it had been-no more than you would get from a spray nozzle on a regular garden hose-and the motor kept running as if still trying to build up pressure and there was suddenly a lot of water spewing out. I turned off and checked the quick connect and the water output hoses and they were properly connected. The water was coming from the bottom of the unit which led me to believe there was a leak somewhere internally that was not allowing the water pressure to be maintained. I had to wait until a week day to reach customer service. At first they tried to tell me that I must have connected the quick connect adapters in reverse but I confirmed that everything was correct. I reconnected everything before my call so I could explain where the leak was coming from. I peered inside the vents near the bottom of the unit and saw water spewing out from around a component inside but the exterior connections were not leaking. When the unit power was turned on, the amount of water leaking increased greatly but it was leaking even when the unit was off once the water supply was turned on.After having me remove the screen filter on the quick connect, the rep determined that if the leak was coming from the pump or elsewhere internally, the unit would have to be returned and replaced as it could not be repaired. Since the unit had been used only an hour or two at most and fully following operating instructions, I decided that the quality was questionable enough that I did not want to get another unit and have the same thing happen. I would not be able to recommend this product based on my experience. I am going back to the drawing board in my search for a durable electric power washer. This time I will look for reviews indicating that the product is good over a longer period of time and not just on the first use. Even though the customer service reps assured me that these problems are rare and they produce some of the best power washers available, I would have to disagree.",

            "review_text": "I am reading all of the reviews on this amazing pressure washer and notice that a majority of them are UE (user error). I am just a housewife that is obsessed with a clean home and I am not the most mechanically inclined person; however, I did read the manual and carefully threaded the pressure hose as well as the garden hose to the machine. Because I made sure that I did not cross thread, nor force the piece to fit, it has absolutely no leaks and has been delight to use. When you first get the machine, take your time on the connections to 'feel the fit' of the attachments and it will be smooth sailing from then on. I absolutely love this powerful machine. My husband first asked me to rent a professional machine to strip and retreat our pergola. We live in San Antonio, so the wood gets a beating. After much agony and research I decided on this one. I am so happy that I decided to purchase our pressure washer than renting one. This one has enough power to clean all what I want it to, and this is without chemicals. I haven't even tried pre-treating the areas that I am going to pressure wash! After testing it out on our pergola, I got fired up to wash the entire front of our house, including the newly installed tile on our patio, stucco siding, front concrete walkway and all the windows! It is so easy to use and the noise was not obnoxious me a bit because once you release the trigger, the machine goes quiet. My neighbors like that part! The only thing is that after a while of washing the walkways, siding, windows, tile and pergola; my fingers started to hurt from pulling the trigger and holding the gun to clean. That is only because I was out there for a while using the machine, the trigger is not hard to press when operating. I will try to follow up on this review with a video of the quality of the cleaning on my driveway. UPDATE: Wed, June 24, 2015 After using it approx. 4 times the GFCI plug is tripping and I must get a new one. I can see that there is some condensation on the test light area of the plug. It is plugged into an outdoor receptacle that is around moisture (I am pressure washing) but has never been submerged nor sitting on the ground where it could have got wet. I am not sure how water got into the plug. So it is currently inoperable and I am really bummed. I planned on pressure washing my neighbor's driveway for $100!!!! But that project is currently on the back burner till I can get in contact with the AR Blue Clean customer service. There is some hiccup in my customer service experience. I have called and left a message; there is no person that has picked up the phone. So I am currently awaiting a call back to see if they can send me another GFCI plug to replace the one that I have. On a good note, the replacement seems very straight forward. There is no video tutorial on how to replace so some searching around allowed me to find out how to do it. It is simply unscrewing the unit by 4 screws, unscrew the positive and negative wire, then swap out the new receptacle by placing the two wires onto correct contact points with a phillips screw. Secure wires by tightening the two screws and then place the protective cap back onto the plug and you are done! **UPDATE 2: I am keeping my 5 star status on this machine; not only because I am in love with it but because I am in LOVE with the customer service!!!! I just tried calling now and Tom S. picked up the phone and trouble shooted me through the GFCI issue. He was very patient and took me through several ways to try to get the receptacle to deliver power to my washer. He even called me back after 5 minutes (so that I could have some time to hook it up outside) and..........he got it to work!!!! I had plugged it to the water, pulled the trigger to make sure that there was water running to the unit. I then plugged it in and pressed the test button, to make sure that it is off. I then pressed the on button (the minus sign). He had me then hold the trigger of the gun while I held in the reset button and WHALLA!!! It started to work again and stayed on! I have my precious pressure washer operating again and I don't have to wait for them to send me a replacement part! Prior to us going through the troubleshooting, he was going to send me the replacement part for free! I just had to email him my proof of purchase and it would be on it's way. I am so happy that I have my precious pressure washer back! Can I say again, I FREGGIN LOVE THIS THING!",

            "review_text": "Have never encountered a piece of equipment with this many design flaws. You would think a company would experiment with a prototype before going into production. I\u2019ve got some modifications to suggest. Here goes: The SWITCH is hidden in a dark recess in back instead of the front where you need it. It\u2019s poorly marked so you will fumble to discover ON vs OFF. Since the pump shuts down automatically, this is not as odd as it sounds. You don\u2019t readily know if it is electrically OFF or the GFCI has been triggered or it is just in the completely quiet auto-pause mode. Both the electrical cord and the hose are the same color (ouch) and roughly the same diameter which will annoy you frequently as they become entangled. The 30 foot long ELECTRICAL CORD has a GFCI plug which you are NOT going to want to drag along the ground connected to your extension cord. (How many jobs are within a 30 foot range of a receptacle?) PLUS, the GFCI will need to be reset as it halts your activity on startup and other occasions. You have to make trips back and forth to your receptacle! Better would have been a simple six inch cord that exits the machine near the top rather than the bottom (where it is vulnerable) Others have mentioned the useless CORD REEL. Here\u2019s a way to make use of it and solve the GFCI problem. Drag out the machine\u2019s electrical cord full length then return the plug towards the unit... thus having exactly halved the cord. Insert the midway loop into the center of the cord reel and roll it all up. Now string the GFCI plug through the big hole in the unit\u2019s handle and let it dangle or tie it up there.... safely off the ground, and consequently voiding use of that obnoxious electrical cord entirely. NOW you can attach YOUR extension cord AT the machine AND be near when the GFCI gets triggered. The plastic (and vulnerable) WATER SUPPLY CONNECTION is, once again, near the bottom of the machine. It has a quick release connect but no turn-off. SO each time you stop work, you have to return to your faucet. Turn it off. Return to the machine. Trigger the spray hose to release pressure. Only then can you release your hose. Here\u2019s what works best for me. Purchase (hardware supply store or on-line) a \u201chose end turn-off unit\u201d and a \u201cquick-release connect\u201d (all brass lasts a LOT longer). Install these on the end of your water supply hose... then right to THEIR plastic quick-release connect. Now you can turn off the water supply AT the machine, release pressure from the spray gun and disconnect your water supply from their machine\u2019s plastic coupling. Otherwise you are stuck with having to unscrew that plastic piece from your hose every single time you quit. ....AND then return the darn thing back to the machine. With my solution you are going to want a SECOND \u201cquick-release connect\u201d for whatever you normally use at the end of your hose. The WHEELS are virtually worthless. Their pressure hose exits in the back at the bottom! Tilting the machine to utilize the wheels scraps it on the pavement. In addition you are going to eventually break off their plastic connect if you try to tilt and wheel the machine on the job with your heavy water supply hose connected. You wind up carrying the machine everywhere. The ACCESSORY HOLDER on the back of the unit does not hold the pressure gun firmly with its nozzle in place. You have to take it apart! So wheeling the machine about during a job is annoying with the pressure gun plus nozzle. OUCH. All this said... Well, tt works. The pressure is good. The adjustable spray nozzle is fine. Others say the pump is well made. I will not return it. BUT WHEW!",

It did a great job of cleaning my 15 year old 30 x 15 ft deck of all the dirt and crud. First, let me tell you, don't buy the Gilmour 7FHS7FH Double Female Swivel Brass Connector, 3/4-Inch by 3/4-Inch and Gilmour 09QCGT 2-Piece Green Thumb Brass Quick Connector Set for Hose. These are the one recommended in the reviews. I read all 527 reviews before buying and knew what to expect, which is why I purchased these. There is nothing wrong with them, but they are not needed. I put everything together and used the brass fittings, when I turned on the maching I got the leak at the hose to washer connection that everyone has talked about. It was quite a bit of spray in that area. I tried using teflon tape and vasiline on the threads, I tried the plastic connector, same spray leak, nothing worked. I proceeded to use the machine anyway and was very impressed. I decided that the machine was so good that I could live with the leaking. I did half my deck the first day, during the night, I reread all the reviews to compile the fixes for the leak. The only thing I didn't try was adding an extra washer at the hose connection. The next morning I went to Home Depot and bought a pack of hose washers, the red rubber ones for $2. I didn't expect too much, maybe lessen the leak. I decided to give the plastic connector a try again. Took out the washer that came with the unit and put two hose washers in and tightened as hard as I could by hand. Turned on and no leak, not a drop. Used the rest of the day with no problem. A fix so simple. And the plastic connector worked great. I like it over the brass because when you disconnect the hose at the quick release the water flow is stopped unlike the brass, where I have to shut the water off with the handle at the other end. I could have saved $12 by not buying the brass fittings. I would say to use the plastic connector as it functions great, and if you ever need to replace then buy the brass. I was afraid I was going to damage the fitting on the washer as I was tightening the fittings as hard as I could with a wrench to stop the leak. When all it took is two hose washers and hand tightening.",

            "review_text": "I was very leery of buying any electric pressure washer but hate dealing with gas engines that sit unused for extended periods of time & I knew that I wouldn't be using it all that frequently. After reading all I could about various electric models I ordered this one & couldn't be happier, or more relieved that I made the right choice. My first use was to clean 18 years of mold off 300' of an 8' wooden picket privacy fence using the adjustable spray wand. I ran the washer for hours at a time, which scares me with inexpensive electric motors, but it never appeared to overheat or give me any reason for concern & did a great job. A few days later I cleaned a neighbor's concrete driveway using the high pressure wand. Again, I ran it continuously for a couple of hours & was very happy with the results. I made a complete pass over the entire surface with only water, then for about 20% of the surface with the most stubborn mold, I poured on generic bleach & swished it around with an old broom, then let it sit for a few minutes. The bleach cleaned up the rest of the mold & I just washed the bleach away with the pressure washer. Both of those jobs were a bit slow but not physically taxing for a 60 year old man in decent condition but I wouldn't mind if the high pressure wand was a little longer (I'm 6'-0\" tall). Even though cleaning the driveway was pretty easy using the high pressure wand, I ordered the 10\" deck/flat surface cleaner for when I clean my own driveway. I also bought a brass double female coupling since I'd read about so many people having leaking issues at the input hose connection. Well, I haven't even taken it out of the package because I have had no leaks other than the minor drips that I'd expect from any hose fittings. My only negative comments about this machine have to do with the tool caddy, the output hose reel & the power plug. I'd guess that a marketing team came up with the tool caddy & hose reel specs. because while they sound like great ideas, the implementation is pretty much useless. The only reason for the tool caddy might be to keep your wands attached to the unit when storing it. The hose reel should probably not be used because it coils the hose too severely & the slot for holding the hose end in place while initially reeling in the hose creates a kink in the hose near the coupling. A reel like this could be OK if the hose was a flexible material but it's pretty stiff & any kink will eventually damage it. My issue with the power plug is that it's huge! It's a GFI-like plug that is physically way oversized, to the point that it makes coiling the cord around the take up \"ears\" (on the tool caddy) a bit more of an issue than it should be - meaning that you have to wind it in such a way as to end up with the plug supported rather than leave it dangling. I ended up totally removing the hose reel & the tool caddy. So I wind the power cord around the handle, creating a nice little \"nest\" for the plug & I store the gun, wands & output hose separately. Removing the tool caddy has the additional benefit of eliminating the useless projections at the back of the unit & making it possible to lay it down in storage or if throwing it in a car. In summary, I love this pressure washer & the fact that I find the tool caddy, hose reel & power plug to be poorly implemented doesn't bother me in the least because otherwise it's a great little machine that can handle just about any pressure washing task that a non-commercial user is likely to have. I'm typically overly critical of products so coming from me that's high praise!",

            "review_text": "Where to begin. I bought this machine to power wash the stucco exterior of my house, although I also intended (and did) use this machine to wash my car, patio, outdoor furniture. You get the picture. Light duty homeowner stuff. I had 4 requirements 1) minimum of 1600psi 2) price less than 200 3) electric powered and 4) external detergent reservoir (i.e one that pulls the detergent at the spray head rather then mixing it in the pump as some do) This fit the bill. I also took the advice of a fellow amazon reviewer who recommended getting a brass male to male adapter to replace the awful garden hose quick connect that come with the unit. That was a big help. Ultimately the machine works , but to get it to a place where it is not nearly useless you need to spend money on upgrades. Essentially the machine has 3 near fatal flaws 1) the spray gun, hose, spray heads etc are trash. They feel and look more like toy laser guns then they do a tool. The spray handle is light flimsy plastic. The trigger and safety are fiddly and prone to sticking. 2) the pressure hose is stiff and difficult to use ( ignore the onboard hose storage spindle it is nonsense) almost feels like a length or pex with brass fittings on the ends And...3) All the attachments are proprietary and crappy and difficult to use ( one of those push and twist cam locks). This set up prevents you from getting an extension wand or better hose or better gun. But if you are willing to spend another 60 or 70 usd on a better hose, and better spray gun then you have a decent machine and the flexibility to add angled spray heads or extension wands or anything else out there that is much higher quality and using the standard pressure washer hardware. So ultimately my all in cost went above my 200 dollar cap but at least now I have a machine that does what I need it to.",

            "review_text": "I just tested this model for the first time today, March 8th, 2014. What I want to warn other would-be buyers is that the supplied plastic hose connector is a piece of garbage. Shame on the manufactures/supplier to force their customers to visit a hardware store and buy a better model that fits properly and does not leak. The supplied garden hose adapter kit that connect this unit to your garden hose is just very poorly made and leaks a lot of water. It is not about tightening more as the water leaks where this 2-part adapter connect together. There is nothing a user can do. So I was forced to visit my hardware store and buy a new Gilmour hose adapter that works just fine, no more leaks. So be ready to buy a better hose adapter if you decide to buy this model. Also, the 20 foot power pressure hose is just too short to wash your car comfortably. I was forced to keep moving this unit closer to where I was power washing. I wish this pressure hose was at least 5-10 feet longer. It is not very practical as it is not possible to wash a car without moving the unit around with you. The water spraying pressure was OK and adequate. I just don't know about this model's durability. I hope it will last a long time, a good many years. I am a light user, maybe I will wash my car once a week, so it is not unreasonable of me to expect several years of good use. Only time will tell, and I will update this review if I experience any unexpected failures or problems. When you turn the power switch on, from 0 to 1, the unit does not start until you pull the trigger gun, so it is a nice feature to have it start automatically, and it does stop when your release the trigger. I hope this company reads these reviews and improve their models. They should start providing better hose adapters and a longer pressure hose. I bought this model here at Amazon for about $130 with free shipping which I believe to be a good and fair price. I have noticed that the price keeps changing, so keep an eye on it. I hope I helped you.",

When i first got it, the spray nozzle was clogged. The unit came with a little tool for un clogging the spray nozzle though, so no big deal. It has never been clogged since, even with unfiltered well water. There is an inline screen with the included hose quick disconnect attachment. Many people say the plastic hose disconnect is fragile, and this probably is true, so you must either be careful with it, or use a brass adapter. I have used the plastic thing the entire time Ive owned it, and I really like it. You have to be careful when moving the pressure washer around that you arent pulling the hose sideways, but this is good practice anyways so i think the plastic thing is a good reminder to be gentle with your pressure washer. The hose reel is stupid. I have the cord wrapped in the reel, and never unroll it. Instead I just bring my extension cord over to the machine. The hose is not particularly flexible, I disconnect my hose and roll it up and hang it on top of the machine every time I use it, and on cold days this task is not as easy, but still doable. The length of the hose is okay, but a few more feet would be perfect. If i place the washer at the side of my vw golf, I can get to every part of the car without moving the pressure washer. However, if I place it infront of my 2 door, short bed truck, i cant get to the tail gate.",

You might be a redneck if...... The latest project has been removing mold from a second story wood deck in preparation for sealing. I used a mixture of TSP and bleach, some light scrubbing and the crap has rolled right off. Looks like new. I did take advice from past reviews and bought the double female brass fitting right off the git go to replace the one that came with it that is prone to cracking. I do wish that the detergent bottle was bigger as you drain it pretty quick. One thing I have noticed is that if you release the trigger and immediately reengage it the machine will cavate and not respond. No big deal. Just count to 1 before you squeeze the trigger again. All in all a great machine to have in the arsenal. UPDATE NOV 2014 The double brass female coupler I bought with this snapped in two. I made up a 2 foot hose with a female hose end on each side.

This unit has one of the highest PSI ratings at 1900 than most electric units which are 1600-1700 PSI. First off, the most annoying thing is the inlet water hose, the outlet pressure hose and the electric cord constantly get tangled up. The outlet hose and electric cord are on the back and the inlet hose connects on the front. If you have to go a distance from the electric outlet and need to use an extension cord, add that into the mix of things getting tangled. Next, unless you are using the jet spray adjustment, which by the way is like writing with a fine liner Sharpie pen, you're not really removing any dirt. If you use a wider angle spray, you have to get within an inch or so of the surface for it to remove the dirt. Now I'm talking about an aluminum awning with just a years worth of dust and dirt on it, nothing else. I used a cleaner designed for power washers, sprayed it on with a pump sprayer, let it sit for the recommended time and used the power washer to remove the dirt. The dirt just laughed at me until I got within that 1-2 inches. I had better luck using a brush and garden hose like I used to use in the past and hoped I didn't need to do that anymore with this power washer. But again at the jet stream setting, it works fine.

They identified several issues with the way I had assembled including \u2022 reversing the garden hose (blue/black) adapter with the water intake (clear) adapter \u2022 cleaning dirt and debris from the screen inside the water intake adapter \u2022 ensuring there was enough water pressure from my garden hose to operate the unit properly 6. They offered a more rugged, longer life, metal adapter to replace the included plastic adapters. They had my unit back up and running again within minutes! Their excellent customer service made me a happy customer and fan of AR Blue Clean!",

This product provides ample water spray pressure for an electric power washer, It took off years of dirt and gunk build up on my driveway and fence. The spray hose is fairly flexible and resists kinks for the most part. The spray bottle attachment works great so you can use a cleaning additive to help get the hard stains off (I used Simple green pro hd). Winding the hose is cumbersome, but doable with some patience. The option is to wrap separate with a Velcro tie. Not a major issue. Ensure that the spray nozzle is fully locked onto the handle or it will fly off when pressure is applied. We lost a nozzle in the water in short order while spraying our dock area, into the deep water never to be seen again! This was our issue by failing to properly lock the nozzle. Overall this is a good machine. Time will tell if it can stand up to repeated uses. Very good product that I would recommend.",

It's taking care of 7 yrs of build-up on my side-walk, drive way, front entrance concrete and back patio. This pressure washer has plenty of power for any cleaning job I would use it for.. People who say it has \"no more power than a regular garden hose\" obviously do NOT have the unit POWERED ON. I followed all the instructions and I've had NO PROBLEM with leaks.. I think others may have leaks because of cross-threading the connections.. So just make sure not to cross-thread them.... Also, when connecting your water hose to the front of the machine, \"push it all the way in UNTIL IT CLICKS\", so that it won't leak. I'm very glad I also bought the AR Blue Clean 10\" Deck, Patio & Flat Surface Cleaner. Save time, water and energy on your next cleaning project. Ideal accessory for cleaning patios, decks and driveways ... This thing is a must-have attachment if you're going to do driveways or sidewalks.. It really does work!.. It's a real time saver compared to just using the wand attachment. I haven't used any cleaning solution yet since plain water is getting the job done with no problem. I highly recommend this pressure washer along with the 10\" Deck attachment.. The cleaning I've done really looks great!",

            "review_text": "Initially, we thought this was a reasonably good product. When it works (see more below), the pressure washing generally does a good job. I would say that it's respectable for power washing the sides of house and Trex decking. We let our friends borrow it to do their wood deck, and they found that it did not really work well for them. We also bought a separate adapter to power wash our concrete patio. That did relatively well but also was of poor quality, which meant that it could take hours to power wash the concrete. [This was my experience both last summer and this spring.] Again, we lent this attachment to our friends for their wood deck, and it didn't work for them. If these were all the issues we faced, I would probably give it 3-4 stars. We experienced a series of problems, however, justifying a 2* rating. Most importantly, it BROKE within one year and three days of purchase. That meant the manufacturer wouldn't lift a finger to help us. That was incredibly depressing considering the amount of our fiscal investment. The other challenge that we had is that the fittings for the power washer are proprietary and not adaptable to other types of machines. The \"rubber hit the road\" for us on this when we tried to use this pressure washer to power wash our gutters. After hours and weeks of research, my husband was unable to find any adapter that permitted this aspect and the manufacturer doesn't supply one. So we were surprised to find that we were completely unable to use this for one of the primary reasons we purchased it. Although we couldn't use this to power wash gutters and it BROKE (sorry for all caps, it's still painful) within a year, we used it reasonably well on our decking and siding (although our friends had problem with their wood deck). So I give it 2* in total. Sorry to burst your bubble about this machine. We wanted to love it. We truly did. But we just didn't. Then again, my husband said: \"I'm not so sad about it breaking in a way, because I'd really like to replace it.\" Think about that before investing your money.",

After cleaning the driveways, patios and walkways of two small properties I own I have already gotten enough use out of this to break even over the cost of paying someone to do the job. Cleaned my barbecue too. The noise level is better than other units I have seen and heard my neighbors use, no high pitched whine. The power cord and pressure hose are of a good useful length. The handle design is less than ideal - the button to lock the trigger off is of no value but there is a serious need for a button to lock the trigger ON to avoid hand cramps. I had to change hands constantly to avoid hand cramps due to the resistance of the trigger. One of the wands is worthless and I could do without it, the other one is adjustable for varied applications. I bought a bottle of antifreeze/lubricant and use it after every job. Seems like a good idea although I suspect it is just automotive antifreeze. The power was only enough for a 1 inch swath of cleaning in my applications but I did find it can clean a two inch swath of siding. I refuse to power clean my siding as it is too hard on the paint and it forces water into walls.",

I've yet to use it for car washing or gentler uses, but will gladly employ the regular nozzle for those duties. On concrete, all you need is the turbo nozzle; no need for chemicals or cleaners! It hasn't slowed down or overheated despite sometimes using it for 2 to 3 hours without a break. If you're looking for a high quality product that works well at a great price, look no further.

I gave it a shot. My review summary in a word: WOW!! I have an in-ground pool surrounded by a concrete patio that is 16 yrs old. I have never power washed the concrete. Even though I hosed it down weekly, the concrete has accumulated ground in dirt along with mold and mildew spots over the years. A strong pressure hose nozzle did not work. I have flower beds bordering the concrete so use of bleach, chlorine or other chemicals was out of the question. I scrubbed the concrete with a stiff broom and baking soda with limited success. I could not totally remove the mold and mildew. After receiving it, I was anxious to try it out, assembled the hose fittings (held off on the tool holder just so I could see how it worked) hooked up the hose and power cord and using the adjustable sprayer, tried it immediately on the mold/mildew and ground in dirt. WOW (again)! The pressure and spray removed the the spots and the dirt immediately! No cleaner solution required! I spent a weekend scrubbing and sweating with little success but after using this, I told myself I should have gotten it sooner! I bought the brass fitting as some recommended but used the plastic fittings first to see how they would work, No Problems, no leaks, no drips, I can hold the wand and grip with one hand for easy control. I just wanted to try it out but ended up cleaning half my concrete deck in about an hour. I could have kept going but it was getting dark. I also purchased the attachment for flat surfaces but haven't tried that out yet. I'll try that out for routine cleaning. Bottom line, this thing is great and at a great price. I don't really care about the storage attachments, I bought it for what it does. Can't wait to try it on my wood deck, vinyl siding and asphalt driveway!",

Read over a dozen forums on electric ones and settled on this one since everyone said it was the best out there. I can say that I was concerned about the adjustable spray wand since I only ever used the kind where the nozzel must be changed out. And finally I was concerned about the plastic speed hose connector, since this is a high stress location. First off I had no reason to be concerned. True the plastic speed hose connector could easily have been metal and not significantly increased price for the strength increase; however it does function properly and when it finnaly breaks, it just screws on where the water hose would, so just buy a metal connector set and be done with it. About the adjustable wand: it is a high pressure nozzel that has a movable \"diffuser\" so you have very high pressure, or you can \"diffuse\" it and it will be lower pressure (clever and ingenious design). The electric pressure unit is fantastic, you cannot \"quick trigger\" it like a paint gun but its not a paint gun, its a pressure washer, so you don't need to. I was very please with the orbital scrubbing wand that came with it; it performed phenominally. All in all for what my opinion is worth, this lives up to its reputation as a legitimate power house pressure washer. I used it to remove surface algea from vinyl siding and brought my home back to looking like new siding in about an hour after 10 years of growth. I also used it to remove about 10 years worth of algea and weathering from my steps, it worked so well it made them match my brand new deck (although if you are going to do this you definitely need to weather seal the wood as soon as the water dries off. All in all for what my opinion is worth, this lives up to its reputation as a legitimate power house pressure washer. Clearly I cannot speak to its longevity, since I have only had it a month. But I would have paid nearly as much to rent one as I paid to own this one.",

As others commented, the hose reel is just for storage and you need to unwind the complete hose to use it, but that was not a problem. The pressure washer is space conscience, besides the hose reel, it has a very good cord wrap, storage for the two nozzles, handle, and sprayer bottle. It takes up very little room in my garage, and is not falling over or causing me to trip over the hose or cord. Also the cord was long enough for me to use around the house and I could easily spray 1 1/2 stories when cleaning. I found it better to do continuous bursts rather than quick short ones, as if you are too quick between bursts the pump will not be primed, so just pause a bit longer. One additional note I had no leaks at all. I used the plastic quick-connect adapter that came with pressure washer and attached this to a short hose which I installed a quick-connect at the other end to attach to my main hoses. This way I had a quick-connect at both ends and using the short hose just to attach the pressure washer to my hose.",

Yeah it might be water efficient but really, the difference of a couple gallons efficiency isnt going to affect your city water supply or your bill but it makes the unit somewhat less effective. I have used ones that claim less pressure than this one yet you couldnt put your hand in front of them. This one is not powerful enough so of course when using it to remove dirt from any object such as a car or concrete, it really is only marginally effective. Also if you go from spraying to release the trigger then spray again as a person normally might do when washing something, if you dont wait a couple of seconds for the unit to recover itself, the motor will run but no pressure will be produced. It will however work again if you wait a few seconds.. Rather annoying tho. The unit is pretty light weight. The storage for the other spray nozzles is cheap and awkward although many brands unfortunately dont seem to put much thought into that. Also its hose reel is very pathetic and barely a selling point. Also, dont plan to use the unit unless you unreel the entire hose and remove it from the reel, because you cant. To put the hose in the reel or remove it is rather lame and the clips to hold the hose are bound to break or damage the hose in short time. The hose is also cheap feeling. The cord storage seems like an after thought and is wrapped behind all the accessories with some brackets that barely accommodate it and speaking of accessories, it only comes with basics.. no fancy patterns or pulse sprays just and adjustable fan to a point and a separate soap bottle dispenser. Another annoyance, since I have used the unit only a few times and far between, I forget which water connection is the in and which is out because it is not marked nor blatantly obvious until you try to shove the hose in the wrong hole and it marginally becomes apparent. Overall, I would definitely recommend looking at other units. For what it has to offer, its price is way to high!",

First, my decision to buy this one over the other ones offered in Amazon is that it has a triplex pump, that is supposed to last longer than the circular pump in the best selling one. The first time I used it was OK, but then on the second time, there was a significant leaking in the water inlet. I did not realize that I placed the connectors the wrong way, since they are designed for a (for me) counter-intuitive placement: the clear plastic piece goes in the body of the washer, and the blue connector goes in the garden hose. It seems that the first time worked without leaking by pure chance and, really, it was my fault since I did not pay close attention to the drawing showing the way to place those connectors (and you'll need a magnifying lens to see it). I contacted the customer service and it really shocked me the way they responded: it is superb!!! They ask me to call them on the very same they I sent the email and clarified my mistake (that was based on the way the connections were made in a previous washer I had). They also offered a metallic adapter as part of the warranty, completely free of charge, that I received a couple of days later. I have used the pressure washer 2 more times, both using the plastic adapters initially included with it (this time I placed them the right way) and also the metallic adapter: not a single drop of water leaked. The washer is very easy to use, much lighter and not as noisy as other electric pressure washers, and provides a pretty powerful water stream that made cleaning my driveway a cinch. Even if it is not perfect (the lances require some care to insert and the hose reel is not very user friendly) it merits 5 stars mostly because of the magnificent experience with a customer service that you would always dream to have with any other manufacturer.",

            "review_text": "Got mine yesterday to replace my worn out 1300 PSI. Have a gas pressure washer too, but its powerful and needed to blast the crud off the bottoms my slipped boats. For light duty use, this unit powerful enough for me. Ran it for a hour messing around the house/shop with zero problems. And I mean ZERO! I read all the reviews too. And as 14 Amps, that about all you well get on a 110v outlet circuit. You want more power, then you must get away from 1.5 GPM electric, and go gas 2.5 GPM. Thats the power needed for big jobs. Now I don't know if some who had problems were caused by \"operator error\", or a bad part that made it past QC. But it does not leak a DROP. ANYWHERE! But I did (and always do)..lubed all connections with Silicone (Plumbers Valve lubricant and sealant). Simple silicone paste in a tube, slather it on the threads, O-Rings (Google search just how a O-Rings works,, and you will understand), and the nozzle to gun. They should include a small tube with it, and directions, but its simple enough. And when moving the unit, don't drag the hose with it. Grab a bit of the hose, and drag it all at one time. Now of some the nit pics. Yes, on the GFCI reset, it should have been made with a short extension cord for the plug, so easy to fit in covered outdoor sockets. But I have a short 2 foot 3 way heavy duty EXT cord, and works anywhere. And if longer reach needed, use a heavy duty cord. On the wand? Yep a little short, and a longer one as a accessory item would be handy. But not a problem me. On the stiff hose? Well, I've had a lot of PW's, and wasn't one hose on any that was not a PITA. Nature of the beast, and needed for the pressure so not bursting. Also forget the hose reel. Nice gimmick, but not really \"workable\" in the real world. Just pop the gun (I LIKE the quick disconnect much better that screw in type!) loop the hose loosely and hang it on the handle. On the power cord? Leave the attachment piece on, leave the attachments off, wrap 1/2 close the back of it, rest on the place intended. Plenty of room. And on pressure? Always run the hose first to clear any air pockets out. My shop is uphill from the front hose outlet, running through 100 feet hose. Had zero problems with the unit. Hope this helps someone. Works as expected for me.",

            "review_text": "I've only used this pressure washer once. I bought this because it's low cost and electric. I'm very happy with it so far for things around the house. I used the bottle with it, mixing 3 to 1 bleach in the bottle, spraying on exterior posts before painting soon. Using the bottle, it doesn't spray with great force, but it works great to get bleach on something to clean, a few minutes later, using one of two wands to wash/clean off the bleach and mildew. One thing i like about the bottle, when using bleach, it doesn't go through the pump, but is at the end of the wand, so i know the bleach wont affect o rings and such. Using the wand, the force and cleaning power is fine. Not as strong as a 2700 psi gas driven pressure washer, but not the cost either. I have only used this to prepare a few doors and posts for painting, but i can see using it to pressure wash my porch, windows, patio furniture. I wont need to rent a pressure washer any longer, this one will do the jobs around my home fine. So for my review, again, I've only used it once. It didn't leak at all as some other posts mentioned, has plenty of cleaning power for the normal jobs around the home. 5 stars because of cost, and it does what it's advertised to do.",

As most everyone says, the hose connector is absolute junk and leaks when not connected to the power washer. My biggest issue is the motor. I received my unit and right out of the box the motor was faulty. It was loud and supplied little to no pressure beyond the household pressure it was receiving. I contacted Amazon and received a replacement very quickly. This replacement unit worked just fine out of the box. After using it for a relatively short period of time, the replacement unit's motor developed the exact same behavior as the original unit. I would not recommend this pressure washer. When working, the pressure seemed pretty good overall but to have 2 motors that are faulty on 2 units is really poor.",

            "review_text": "The unit itself is good and works as expected, but I do not have any previous experience with other pressure washers. For the price, I would say it exceeds what I would expect. However... and this will most likely not effect 99% of people who will purchase this unit or similar... All fitting and sizes used on this unit appears to be a custom proprietary size made by AR Blue. They have their own version of a \"quick-connect\" to quickly change out their tips, which I believe is inferior to the standard quick-connect design, but I bought the MTM foam cannon along with the AR Blue Clean and they are NOT compatible nor can I find a way to make the AR Blue gun fit. I researched online and seems like there is a connector from AR Blue that allows for more standard connections so placed an order for that, but probably should have called them as the adapter for this is not a standard from what I have found (Somewhere around a 3/4\" pipe size if I remember) and they may actually have that. All of the sizing occurred at a business that specializes with pipe and hose fittings, something like 20,000 sq feet warehouse full of hose and pipe fittings. Either case, I wanted to use that foam cannon, so I basically had that business to do a custom job on the AR Blue Clean hose line. Below is what I used for anyone that is interested. 1. Cut the end of the hose that connects to the main unit (the thread appears to also be a custom proprietary fitting). This part now sticks out like 8 inches out. Call this hose #1 2. Add a male quick-connect to hose #1 3. Cut the other end of the hose that connects to the gun. Call this hose #3. Hose #2 would be the longest piece. 4. Add a male quick-connect to hose #3. This allows me to still be able to use the AR Blue's gun. 5. For hose #2 (the main hose), Added a female quick-connect on both ends. 6. Bought a new gun to connect to the new foam cannon. Gun is heavy and feels like the quality is good (essentially a brass gun with a plastic shell). The job done was superb. This was not a barb hose fitting that will essentially add a small hose reduction in the line, the connections they did went over the hose and crimped on top of them. Basically the same thing AR Blue did on their side with the gun's quick-connect tip (which appears to be a modified 1/4 male quick-connect, lathed to have a flat spot). Overall the cost was around $100 (minus cost of the new foam cannon). I am happy to have this done and believe it was well worth it. However, if I knew this from the start, I would have looked for a setup that uses standard sizes in the first place, which is probably any other setup. On the plus side, If I need to change out the hose to be longer, or use different adapter tips, I have the ability to do that fairly quickly, but most likely will not need this at all. Some other gripes on the unit: 1. Plastic hose fittings... replaced those to brass ones as well. This one is a standard size since it has to fit to the hose sizes that people actually own. Some smaller gripes on the unit: 1. Now for the reason I broken the hose line into 3 parts: machine, hose, gun. If I am not mistaken, I believe the instructions for the AR Blue clean states that it is recommended to disconnect everything. Not sure if needed to be honest and probably does not matter, but the hose reeler they have does not work in a way I thought it should and I think it asks to disconnect from the machine to properly reel it up (to look pretty). I was basically not using it and was just coiling the hoses and hanging it over the handle or store it somewhere else if I find a better place. 2. A \"full\" plastic gun. Not too sure how I feel about this, but does feel cheap in the hand even though it functions as expected. A word to AR Blue: Please AR Blue, please stop using these proprietary fittings. I do not believe there is a single person that will say \"I'm sure glad they made these parts difficult for me to replace or fit other components on to this\". I understand it will force people to buy directly from you if something breaks, but honestly this is just the wrong way to do this. The unit is good so please do not waste money to make the molds for all the special parts. I think the unit itself speaks for itself for how well it works. I can overlook the smaller gripes as it should not change how it works, but if the unit does die, I will most likely be buying a different system where the majority of the reason being the power of the unit and not so much on having the adapter fitment issues, which I have resolved.",

            "review_header": "good product, but leaks", 
            "review_text": "The gas powered pressure washers generally supply higher pressures than the electric ones, but they are more expensive, require more maintenance, and are very heavy. I wanted a unit that I could carry around by hand and transport it easily to other locations. This unit had good reviews and was rated at 1900 psi, a high pressure for an electric pressure washer. I have had this product for over a year now, and it is still working well. I have used the unit to power wash my deck, the entire siding on my house, my daughter's deck and lattice work, my concrete driveway (before staining/sealing it), my concrete sidewalk (before repairing it), my truck (on a regular basis), my travel trailer, garbage cans, bird baths, and probably a few more things that I may have forgotten about. One of the biggest problems with this product is that it leaks. I almost gave it a 4-star rating because of this problem, but I have used this pressure washer successfully for so many things and have overcome the leak problem, so I gave it 5 stars. The unit itself has a male fitting for water inlet, so you can not connect a garden hose directly to it. Instead, they provide a plastic fitting with female joints on each end and a filter in between. I was unable to stop it from leaking badly with this connection, so I purchased a Gilmour 7FHS7FH Double Female Swivel Brass Connector, 3/4-Inch by 3/4-Inch, sold by Amazon, and used this to connect the unit to a garden hose. I then leave the double female brass connector on the pressure washer all the time, and connect the garden hose to it when I need to use it. This connection solved the leak problem for the most part, although there is still a constant slow drip most of the time -- not much of a problem since you are using it outside. Another thing you may want to consider is how much pressure do you need for the job you want to do. If you want to strip all the paint from a deck, this unit may not be suitable. When I used it on my daughter's deck, it removed all of the loose paint and then some, but did not remove all of the paint (okay for our purpose). When I used it on my deck, I just wanted to clean it up before re-staining, and it worked fine for that. While it cleans my truck well, it does not remove all of the brake dust from the hub caps. My unit, purchased 1 1/2 years ago, came with two lances, a turbo lance and an adjustable lance. The turbo lance spins the spray jet, while the adjustable lance can focus the jet from a point to a broad fan-shaped spray. I used the adjustable lance most often because it provided more pressure, and most of the time I would use it in a fan spray. I purchased an older house about 1 1/2 years ago and it had green algae particularly on the north side of the white house. When the siding was power washed (using the fan spray of the adjustable lance) the green cast on the house turned white, so you could easily see what was cleaned and what was not cleaned. It was necessary to hold the end of the nozzle a few inches (3-6 inches the best to my recollection) away from the siding in order to wash off the algae. This means that the width of the spray band hitting the house was narrow, so it took quite a bit of time to clean the whole house. A more powerful gas powered pressure washer would likely to be quicker. On the other hand, this electric unit was very light weight, and I could easily carry it around the house with one hand (it has a handle at the top). In order to reach the peak of the house, I placed the unit on the support near the top of a step ladder, held it on with a bungee cord, then climbed an extension ladder with the gun in hand to reach the peak. I point this out only to demonstrate the portability of this unit. You could not do this with a heavy gas powered pressure washer. The unit also comes with a soap dispenser. Just place a little liquid detergent in the container, fill it with water, connect it directly to the gun (in place of the lance) and spray it on your car or truck. It lasts maybe 10-15 minutes until the soap runs out, enough time to soap up your vehicle. Then switch over to a lance and power wash it. While the unit comes with a hose reel, I find it just as easy to wind up the hose by hand, tie it with a shoe string and set on top over the handle. I do the same with the electric power cord. Make the loops small enough so they don't slide down over the unit and you have one neat package that you can pick up by the handle and carry around. This is a good, fairly powerful, relatively inexpensive, lightweight, reliable power washer that has served me well.",

I had to keep the jet very close to the surface of the wood and go back and forth a few times to get it really clean. If you have any sign of arthritis in you hands, forget about using it. There is nothing to lock the handle while spraying, and it needs to be pressed all the time to do the work. You will need some strong hands if you are planning to do a job for more than 3 minutes. After a while I had the idea of using a velcro fastener to keep it hold for me. ( see photo of the velcro fastener) All in all it is an ok tool, but I am still thinking if I am going to keep it.",

I read all the reviews about this product and with mild trepidation decided to take the plunge and buy it. I read about the leaks, the rigid hose and the plastic adapters but they were few in comparison to the good reviews. Every product will have bad and good reviews, its normal the way I see it. So, here is what I did before I actually received the AR383, I went to the AR website and ordered the metal attachment for the garden hose to the AR383 so I would not have that headache of stripping the threads or having major leaks. I also ordered the 25ft extension hose to further extend the reach of the washer hose without having to constantly move the AR383 around the garage. Both items worked perfectly but I did have the problem of the rigid hose being very uncooperative and would recoil itself into a tangle. The turbo nozzled worked very well, cleaning some of the tougher stains on the garage floor, even lifting up dried paint from older projects. The variable spray on the other wand worked great too, I love that I do not have to change tips on the wand and instead just need to twist it to get the desired spray or stream. The wheels are awesome with this washer and very easy to wheel around corners, use the handle to move the unit and don't try to drag it with the pressure hose, you're asking for trouble in the form of leaks. What I really liked about this unit is the fact that the pump stops when you release the trigger and will start up again when you squeeze it. It cuts down on the noise from the unit but I admit that it was not as noisy as a pressure washer I used from another brand that would constantly run regardless if you're spraying or not. All in all, I was very happy with this purchase, I was able to clean out the garage, wash down some chairs and even did a quick wash on my truck and it didn't take all day. Only issue I would say is that the hose is very rigid and like one of the other reviewers I just coiled it and laid in on the top of the unit, no problem for me.",

After storing it for the winter/spring, I pulled it out to wash cars with it, and the spray gun hose connection to the pressure washer was done for. Once connected, more water was getting me wet than traveling through the wand, or so I thought! The bad seal prevented any real pressure from building and was just spraying from the base of the spray gun. Well, I thought, I'll just replace the spray gun! A new gun came and I tried again, with the same result. I wish I could return it for the wasted money and effort!",

I was concerned that any electric power washer wouldn't have enough power to do the job, but this one worked great. I've used both the turbo wand and the regular, adjustable wand and was able to quickly and easily remove 98% of all the accumulated grime on my deck, vinyl siding, and concrete. I haven't tried it on my asphalt driveway yet but I plan to soon and I'm confident it will do a great job. NOTE: my deck is \"Fiberon\", a composite material so I didn't have to worry about stripping paint or wood. Also, I used straight water with no chemicals or cleaning additives; I'm sure if I would have added something the results would have been even better still, but I'm very pleased with how well this works out of the box with just water. Initial setup was probably 10 minutes at most. I wanted to give this a rare 5-star review (rare for me - I only give 5 star reviews to products that I can't think of any possible way to make them better), but two things keep me from doing so. The first is that there is no way to lock the sprayer 'on' so it keeps spraying without you having to hold the trigger. The trigger is easy to pull, but after using it for 2 hours or more your arms start to get tired of having to constantly keep pressure on the trigger. There may be some legal/safety reason for not allowing you to lock it 'on', but it was an obvious need for me on the first use. The second issue I have is that every time you plug it in, you need to hit the 'reset' button on the power adapter. Sounds quick and easy, but it never seemed to work the way I thought it should. I'd plug it in, hit 'reset', and return to the washer to turn it on only to have it not work and have to go back to the power adapter and hit the 'reset' button again. Without any power indicator light on the main unit, the only way to see if it's getting power is to keep turning it on, trying it, and going back to hit 'reset' again several times in a row until it turns on. Not sure why it's designed this way and it makes no sense to me. In the grand scheme of things, the minor annoyances are just that - minor. I'm very happy with this purchase, I feel I got great value for the dollar and I'd recommend this for general deck and siding cleaning without hesitation.",

The connectors coming with it attach to your standard garden hose, and the (unfortunately completely useless) patio cleaner can be attached without any further tool or connector unless some of the reviews stated. You can tell that the latest devices have gone through evolution and refinement, hence there is a good deal of functionality delivered. The star less relates to the little drum - which is really a useless gimmick, as it will tip the machine over if you consider using it for the hose. If you have trapped a rattlesnake in your backyard and are looking for a fine place for storage after knocking her unconscious - this is probably a good feature. Buyers beware: The cleaner is not recommended to use on your finger or toe nails.",

The lack of onboard detergent tank/mixing is a minor inconvenience that we got around by using a pump sprayer that holds 1.5 gallons of whatever potion you choose. I'm 6'3\" so the supplied wands are a tad short, just perfect for 5'5\" Karen. The turbo nozzle makes delightfully short work of concrete cleaning - built up mildew and leaf tannins over the winter/spring. Makes knocking the (north side) green mildew off the vinyl siding an easy task. Relatively quiet, needs an extension handle for easier pushig/pulling around the yard. But it cleans like crazy - little effort - literally a point and shoot affair. We like it.",

            "review_text": "This is the 4th electric pressure washer I've owned over the years and it is clearly the best so far. My use is for cleaning deck, patio, sidewalk and driveway and all the units I have owned have handled those tasks reasonably well. The only real question is how well this one will hold up compared to the others, and only time will tell for that. My last one, a 1550psi Husky lasted 4 years before a seal gave out so I hope this one does as well. It definitely produces more pressure than the Husky did, although it may or may not reach 1900psi. It also has a better adjustable nozzle than my prior models (same basic design, varying from fan to jet). A dedicated power wash nozzle is included as well, although I can't tell it does any more than the adjustable nozzle on its jet setting. I don't use the cleaner dispensers that comes with these things, but they all appear to have the same idea ... fill the bottle with the cleaner solution and use the bottle in place of a nozzle to spray the cleaner on whatever surface you are working on, then put the nozzle back on and power wash. The nozzle system is the same quick connect design my old unit used, easy to put on or remove by a simple push and twist. As might be expected, the power cord has a GFCI plug, pretty much a necessity for an electrical appliance used around water. Others have complained about leaking at the supplied plastic quick connect filter, but I have had absolutely no issue there. It may be that the water pressure from my supply is low enough that it won't compromise the O-ring seal on the filter connector, and anyway, if the quick connect breaks or does begin leaking, it would be simple to replace it with a brass female-female connector as others have suggested, perhaps adding a washing machine filter. Just be sure you realize the supply hose connects to the front, not the rear. It really should be marked on the unit, not left to reading the directions. What I really like about the design of this particular model is that you can store everything on it. For all of my past units I had to retain the shipping box to store the unit and its paraphernalia. The cleaner solution bottle for this unit is even shaped to neatly fit in the bracket for holding the nozzles, trigger handle, power cord, with even a slot for the hose quick-connect filter. The reel on the top is for storing the pressure hose. That makes for pretty effective, compact storage. Incidentally, like all pressure hoses I've experienced, the one supplied is pretty stiff, but unlike the others has really good kink protection on each end. Some complain about the plastic look and feel for this unit, but that makes for something light enough to be easily moved around. For me the one real con is the trigger handle, which could use some ergonomic improvement. I found it more tiring to use than the one on my old Husky, particularly for a forward-reverse sweeping motion. For the unit to work properly, you also have to be sure you've purged any air out of your supply line (by triggering the nozzle with the power off). On releasing the nozzle trigger, I found the automatic motor cut out needed about a 1 to 2 second pause to re-engage the pump when your pressed the trigger back on, a minor annoyance. Overall, this is a solid 4-star product, especially given its price point. It does have a few minor shortfalls, but is an effective power washer for small jobs like a patio or pool deck, has a superior system for packing it up for storage, and is light enough to take where you would not take a gas-powered unit. I am quite satisfied with it. Just don't expect the kind of pressure the gas models can deliver.",

            "review_text": "I use this with the AR Foamer Canon to produce shaving cream suds when washing cars. It does a nice job during the winter months (above freezing days) removing road grime and salt when you can't do a proper car wash. This is perfect for washing cars and doing other small power washing duties around the house. The hose reel is for winter storage, not daily storage. I just wrap the hose around the machine during the cleaning season. The hose connector/filter is plastic, so I'd suggest you purchase a backup connector, along with an o-ring kit, just in case. I ordered the parts directly from AR Blue Clean and while the parts costs are reasonable, the shipping cost is outrageous, even for small parts - hopefully that's changed now. Also, consider getting a longer hose, so that you can park the machine and walk around the vehicle without having to move it. Either that or consider the AR390, which has a 30' hose. The AR Foam Canon is similar to this unit, but sold under AR's name. You need to purchase directly from AR because of the proprietary hose connector: http://www.arblueclean.com/Products/ar-foamer-cannon-153.cfm Professional Foam Lance Adjustable with 32 oz. Bottle Update: (3-29-15) I've experience some major problems with the pressure washer, so wanted to pass along what's been happening. I have changed the star rating from 5 to 2 for the moment. I have notified AR to see how this will be handled. I will update accordingly, but as of now, I am not happy with the machine. I use the machine maybe once every 1-2 weeks since I purchased it, which is not a whole lot of use. Below are my issues: 1. I can't remove the adjustable spray nozzle from the spray gun; it just will not release from the gun. 2. The pressure washer cycles (revs) constantly every 2 seconds when idled (not being used). Similar to like squeezing the trigger and then quickly letting go. (will try and add a video later) 3. Just recently the pressure washer, while idling, revved up and ran on its own without my input (I was washing the truck at the time), but when I press the spray gun trigger to try and stop it, it continued running, but had no pressure at all; just a misty spray. I also recommended their Foamer Cannon, which is a nice attachment, however, the bottle did not last long; the bottle head ripped away from the threads as I unscrewed the bottle from the brass threads on the Foamer Cannon. The bottle that comes with the kit is very, very soft when compared to some of the higher end detail style bottles I use. I use hot water to mix with the solution and I believe the hot water made an already soft bottle even softer and thus, the bottle tear. Amazing. I'm just not a happy camper at the moment.",

It's much lighter than my previous electric pressure washer but nicely fills a need when I don't want to bring out my big gas machine. It naturally has some limitations and potential problems. The pressure is good, but there is an irregular surging that is annoying. I can't find the cause (no kinks in hoses, etc.) and it is not that prolonged. Still, it concerns me about longevity. It has a unique way of connecting a garden hose with two plastic snap connectors. Once attached they protrude about 3-1/2\" from the body, making it vulnerable if it fell forward or was bumped while the hose is attached. Remember these are plastic connectors. I use a brass \"quick connecter\" for everything that goes on my hose. With that attached, the hose is 5\" from the body and seems vulnerable. The other minor issue is the \"convenient\" pressure hose reel. It's only 7\" in diameter so it takes some planning to coil the hose, especially if you--as i do--leave the one end attached to the pump. After unreeling, you will find you have to uncurl it to avoid kinks. Overall, a pretty good machine which, as with every product, required a series of compromises trying to balance size, weight, power, cost and convenience. UPDATE: I've owned and used this for more than a year, except of course during our Wisconsin winters. As I feared, the hose connection was vulnerable and broke a few weeks before the warranty expired. The GOOD NEWS is that the company now has a metal connector which they sent me under warranty which works wonderfully and seems much more durable. The other GOOD NEWS is the customer service. I've had to contact AR by phone a couple of times and each time I was treated with promptly with courtesy and helpful advice. While part of this washer are flimsy and prone to breakage, the functional part works very well and is back by excellent customer support.",

I uploaded a pic to show the result. I'm probably going to hire someone with a gas-powered washer to redo the patio, since all the clean lines (where the narrow stream was used) stand out in high-contrast (to the rest where the fanned spray was used). For cleaning patio furniture and the like it was great. I had no problem with the hose connection leak many complained about.

Contrary to some previous reviews, I don't find it difficult to roll up the pressure hose on the reel. At temperatures of 70-90 degrees it is very flexible; maybe it gets a bit more stiff at lower temps. As lots of people have noted the plastic connector which comes with it is a piece of junk, but there's no reason to buy the metal part sold by this company. All you need is a double female garden hose coupler which you can buy at Lowes or HD. I don't bother with a quick connect but use the couple with a shutoff valve so I can connect and disconnect the hose without having to turn it off at the spigot. The electrical cords and the pressure hose are both quite long which makes it easy to wash a car without having to move the device itself very much, or at all. When you do pull on the pressure hose the device rolls nicely on its wheels without falling over. I was surprised and pleased by that; someone actually planned and executed a good design.",

Remember the quick connect adapter attaches to the front of the AR383.. the blue end goes on the hose and the clear part goes on the AR383. I have no leaks whatsoever with this connection and just hand tighten all connections. The high pressure hose attaches to the back and you have to hold some pressure on the hose when first attaching the threaded coupling, then it screws in nicely. No leaks here either. When removing the high pressure hose, you have to pull it strongly after releasing the threads to get the o-ring to release. I like the tips I've seen to use the hose reel to store the electrical cord and loosely wind up the high pressure hose and drap it around the handle for storage. Also, when you order this, go ahead and order a spare pack of 0-rings. Mine are badly cracked after 3 years (of mostly non-use) and the high pressure hose leaks where it fits into the handle because the o-ring there is cracked and broken. The leak is not bad so I can still use it. These are metric o-rings, but I don't know the size. I have a set inbound as I type this. Pluses: the AR383 does a good job on mildew on concrete and brick. Minuses: the AR383 with either the adjustable flat spray or the orbiting spray will clean mildew about an inch width at a time. For my sidewalk, I can do a square (expansion joint to expansion joint... about 4 ft X 4 ft) in about 15 minutes. So it will take a while to clean and is tedious work. Note: I have not used other pressure washers, especially high powered gas engine pressure washers, so I can't compare. Hopefully a higher powered pressure washer can clean more than an inch width at a time. But they are also much more expensive than the AR383 too. So I guess you get what you pay for. Regardless, for my occasional use, I am well pleased with the AR383.",

The cord is long, and the limiting factor when looking at how far you can go away from the house to continue cleaning driveways, etc. But you could also add a heavy duty extension cord and thus reach as far as you reasonably wanted to go. The hose from the cleaner to the wand is also decent length, but the real hose length that matters is your own garden hose that you hook up to the cleaner. A couple of strong recommendations: if you are cleaning a large surface (patio/driveway) it is well worth it to buy and use the 10\" surface cleaner...it cut the time to complete the task by 75% easily. Also, I would not waste time with using the detergent bottle or run it through the cleaner, nor even buy their special detergent. Just take some liquid dish soap and sprinkle a little on the surface before you start washing with the cleaner. Much cheaper, quicker, and no clean up required. Just saying....",

            "review_text": "A few years ago I rented a pressure washer from a tool rental place, for $65 for a day. It was gas powered and exceedingly heavy. It was so difficult to lug around that I only got around to pressure washing one or two areas before returning it. So a week ago I bought the AR383 pressure washer, and boy am I glad I did. I've used it for a few hours each day for the last few days, and I've gotten everything done that I could think of doing. The car. The concrete apron in front of the garage. The slate stairs from the driveway up to the backyard. The retaining wall at the bottom of the driveway. The stone front door stoop. The slate patio on the left side of the house and the concrete one on the right. The concrete birdbath. It did a great job. It has more than already paid for itself. And it's easy to move around. It has plenty enough power for my needs, and it's quiet. Negatives? There is more electric cord than will fit without bulging out on the plastic accessory holder, plus it takes a while to wind it all (not that I'm complaining about the long cord). I didn't even bother trying to wind the high pressure hose around the hose reel, figuring that would be just as much of a pain to deal with (as others have noted). So, as others have done, I just create one loop of electric cord and one of hose, tie each with two Velcro straps, and drape both on the handle. Easier, actually, than trying to use the accessory holder and hose reel. Also, the unit is small and light and low enough that I don't bother wheeling the unit around -- I just pick it up by the handle and carry it. So, if I was altering the design, I would nix the electric cord portion of the accessory holder and nix the hose reel (replacing both with some sort of large plastic hooks to hang the loops of cords on), and get rid of the wheels (yes, there's another model without wheels, but it's got a lower PSI than this model). If I could subtract 1/4 star for the the cord winding issue I would, but I can't, so I'm rounding up to five stars. I bought this to be a pressure washer, and pressure wash is what it does well. I didn't buy it to wind the cord and hose up in a certain way. Hanging the cord and hose from the handle is no big deal to me.",

CONS: turning on the machine requires a few extra steps - making sure it is off first, and then plugging the power cord in and pressing the reset button to make sure a red indicator is present in the GFCI window, and then turning it on. Even when you do that, sometimes the machine doesn't pump when you turn the switch on, making you think you have a non-working lemon. If you press the trigger handle, however, and relieve the water pressure in the line, the pump will kick on. The other con is the cleaning solution bottle attachment does leak - luckily I choose relatively non-toxic cleaning solutions.",

I was able to get it restarted by keeping the unit plugged in while pushing reset, then test (until it clicks) and then reset. I haven't used it for a significant amount of time yet - but it did stay started this time. The trick was leaving it plugged in while re-setting. Also, the tech I spoke to on the phone gave me a tip that if you need to use an extension cord, you actually can as long as it is 12 or 10 gauge (heavy or extra heavy duty cord). Just thought I'd pass that tip along. I used this pressure washer once and it worked fine in August of 2014 when I purchased it. I used it again the second time in May 2015 and it came on for 2 seconds, died, and wouldn't restart. I emailed AR for Warranty Info and didn't hear back. I called and the first person I spoke to told me they had gotten over 400 emails and were extremely behind.

            "review_text": "Got this on lightning deal and was worried about some of the bad reviews but my unit works like a champ. Strong enough to put grooves in my composite deck when focused to a narrow stream! As pointed out, don't use the built in reel to wind up the stiff hose. Instead I use it to wind up the long power cord. Just hook the halfway point of the power cord on one of the reel protrusions and you only have half the length to wind. I found it useful to mark the halfway point with duct tape. Coil the stiff hose separately and drape over the unit and you are done. Pros: Quiet, powerful and compact storage. Used 5 times so far and no problems. Plastic hose connectors are sturdy and no leaks. Cons: Does not store as described in the manual but alternate storage solution works great. Power brick on end of cord may prevent it from seating fully into an outdoor recessed electrical outlet so grounded extension cord may be needed. Read the manual fully to understand how to turn it on. For example, the line needs to be full of water or the pump may be air locked and the power brick reset button MUST be pressed every time it is plugged in. Water will flow at normal hose pressure even if the pump is off which is why some reviews say it is no better than a hose. 5 stars minus 1 star for minor inconveniences",

Subsequently, I had a bit of difficulty threading my garden hose onto the plastic threading of the machine's adaptor. Emailed this time and, within moments, not only had a reply, but a promise to send me a replacement piece \"just in case\" the threading issue was theirs, not mine. And, not more than 30 minutes later, I received a second email saying they were going to upgrade that replacement piece to a metal-threaded piece, instead. So, I've now used the machine on our garage floor and tiled patio - excellent results! Great product at a great price, with great support behind it.",

            "review_text": "You buy electric over gas for one or more of the following reasons: less expensive, lighter, smaller, quieter, easier to maintain and use, and safer. 2000psi is top range for an electric unit, it that is not enough, don\u2019t criticize the unit, you should have bought gas powered. I have used the washer for about 9hrs and it has worked great. This unit has excellent price/performance. Features: 1900 PSI \u2013 at the top range for electric pressure washers 1.5 GPM - Good flow rate. (It\u2019s not just the pressure, it\u2019s how much water can be pushed out at that pressure. When comparing units, multiply the PSI by the GPM to get a single \u201ccleaning value\u201d) Triplex pump w/ stainless steel plunger \u2013 Long lasting pump design and much better than axial cam or wobble pumps. However, to keep cost down, the AR383 uses a universal motor instead of the quieter and cooler running Induction Motor. (I could not find an electric that had both Triplex pump and Induction Motor). Pump auto shuts off when wand trigger is released, so there is no worry about overheating the pump. Noise level of the unit is good. 27lbs \u2013 Light weight. So light that it was easier to carry the unit than try and pull it using the wheels 20ft stiff plastic pressure hose and 30ft power cord. Hose tends to stay coiled, so straighten it out before attaching to unit and wand. The reel is not worth using and because of the 3\u201d stiff ends of the hose and small diameter of the reel, could eventually cause a stress break in the hose. Nice long power cord, but the location of the pressure hose fitting requires you to unwrap all 30ft of cord to get to it. The instructions say not to use an extension cord. I did use a 100ft 14 gauge cord with it and the GFI plug became extremely hot. I would suggest using no more than a 50ft 12 gauge extension cord if you need to extend the reach. I did not have the leaking problem with the plastic water hose connector; however I used my own Melnor female quick hose connector rather than the one that came with the unit. (Note: The clear plastic male connector it has a screen mesh filter to prevent debris from damaging/clogging the unit, something a replacement brass connector may not have). The connector for the water hose is located on the front of the unit, while the high pressure hose and power cord connect on the back. This makes it harder to keep the cable and 2 hoses from tangling when moving the unit The pressure hose attachment to the wand handle is very simple to use and is in front of the trigger, which gives the wand better balance. It comes with 2 spray ends that just insert and twist into the handle: A variable fan spray nozzle and a turbo nozzle (pinpoint spray that twirls around in a circle.)",

Well, the little part attaching the hose to the gun is plastic and a piece of junk. It broke without anything happening to it. I tried to buy a replacement part but you have to buy the gun to get it. It is almost 10$ and then they charge you another 10 for shipping. So..do I spend 20$ for another junk part which I assume will also break?

So, do not plan on power washing the second or third story of your home. Even if you have a ladder and are strong enough to lift the AR Blue up the ladder, it is less effective. And, the detergent bottle is useless more than 10 feet above your head or 5 feet away from you. So with this washer, you need to apply your cleansing detergent via a power nozzle on some other device, then rise with the AR Blue washe. Also, follow the Assembly and Operating instructions closely, or the machine will not function or will shut off frequently. Just as with any electric PW I have owned, extension cords reduce its useable time, and must wait for machine and extension cord to cool down. But it is effective and priced well for cleaning below your chest height, and if you have severl extension cords to substitute rather than wait for one to cool down..",

I think the hose reel could have been done better and provided more space for extensions. Also the storage of the power cord is not that great. The wands also do not like to fit the plastic holders that well. Overall they are alright features but could definitely be reworked to be more useful. As for the pressure washer itself it is awesome. I purchased this with the intention of washing my car and for that purpose it works wonderfully. I purchased the AR blue clean foam cannon to go with this and together the two work beautifully I attached some pictures of the cannon and the unit and how my car looks foamed with the two items using meguirs deep crystal ( a very cheap shampoo that works great). I tried the cannon on cleaning cracks on the driveway and sidewalk and it was also good at that really got in there and pushed out the dirt. The only thing if any I felt kind of disappointed with would be the turbo nozzle it did not seem like it was that great at cleaning sidewalks but I honestly never gave it a proper test. Overall it did the job, but seemed to take a bit longer. If i used cleaner before it, probably would have worked better. The detergent bottle that comes with this item is referred to as a foam bottle sometimes, I do not know why. The detergent bottle is just that detergent, its meant to add strong chemicals before cleaning sidewalks, fences, and other parts of houses. It is not meant to be used to foam up your car they don't work the same way as foam cannons. I seen some reviewers mention that the bottle sucks at cleaning cars, that's cause it is not meant for that task. Now about the unit itself. It is a very small and portable unit, it is very lightweight so just about anyone including elderly people should have no problems bringing this out for pressure washing. The unit is made out of a hard plastic, and looks to be very durable. The connection on the front of the unit which is the filter that connects to a hose seems like a softer plastic so I am kind of worried about its durability in the long term that goes the same for the hose end attachment. I have used the pressure washer like 10 times so far and no issues. People complain about the front filter/hose connection leaking, I only had that issue if i improperly connected the hose. Usually just a simple reset of the hose fixed the issue every time, people who say its constantly leaking probably are not doing something right, or they damaged the threads. Luckily the parts are pretty cheap less then $15 last I checked. Best thing about this unit it is very quite, which means you can take this out at anytime of the day and not worry about neighbors giving you hell for disturbing them. I took out the unit when a neighbor was using their gas and they could not believe how easy to use and quite the pressure washer was. On top of that it felt more powerful then his 2k gas pressure washer.",

On the other hand, if you want to clean dirt/mold off your deck, lawn furniture, house, etc. this is a light, convenient and easy to use unit. It is MUCH lighter than a gas powered washer and, rather than fighting with a pull-cord to get it started, you simply have to plug it in and pull the trigger. A lot of other reviews complain about the low pressure (garden hose) side of the connection leaking like a sieve and they are right. (I can't figure out why AR hasn't improved this simply based on the input from Amazon purchases???...) But rather than purchasing a brass hose coupling as many suggest, I found that putting in a second hose gasket on each side of the coupling stopped the leaking and, most likely, is better for your warranty since the AR supplied coupling appears to have a built in water filter in it to keep particles in the water from reaching the pump.",

My well had no problem keeping up, the hose reel works OK and the electric cord wrap is just big enough.

Could not believe the dirt which was removed after two years of use. Cleaned outside windows, the patio, the garage floor, and the car. Now, I have run out of things to clean. Oh well, next year it will start over. After reading several reviews about the power, I have the feeling that the pump was never turned on. Remember you must connect the water, turn it on, connect the power plug to 110 Volts, make sure the reset button is pushed in and the power switch is turned on. I have never used directions much, but this time I had to use them to find the use of the power switch, which does not look like a power switch, because it is covered with plastic and is completely invisible. you just have to place your finger on the plastic and push on the right, then left until you feel the movement of the switch. The plastic is there to protect the switch from water exposure. The reset button has to be pushed each time you plug it into the power receptacle. In all, this is a great device and I hope it does the same job next time I use it, hopefully in about three months. Getting excited about cleaning things isn't my normal way of life. Ha!!!",

I replaced the cheap plastic fitting, and it still leaks horribly. Attaching the wand hose to the machine is a chore since there is not enough finger room around the threads to be able to screw the hose in tightly. The roller on the top is a complete joke--there for cosmetic purposes only. You'll never, I mean ever get the hose wrapped up on the roller. Just forget about it. The plastic jug connection attaches at a weird angle, forcing you to hold the wand at a 45 degree angle to keep the jug from losing its contents. If you have to set the wand down for a second (to untwist the electric cord from the pressure hose, which is something you will have to get used to) the wand with connected jug will, with all certainty, fall over and the contents of the jug will completely empty out. The design of this product is just atrocious.",

I had to file my hose threads so they were perfect of the fittings wouldn't go on. All other garden fittings worked fine on my hose. Once on properly they don't leak. Patience was required but it works now. 2. Hose reel is essentially useless. Only for storage and even then not exactly great to unwind given the base of the fitting sometimes catches while unwinding making it a single turn by turn affair. 3. Electric cord storage has to be the worst I've ever seen. Seems like it was designed for a cord 8 ft shorter than needed. Taxing. 4. Soap dispenser sits at about a 30 deg angle on the gun instead of hanging down straight and it isn't me just not putting it on correctly. Not a big deal but the internal fitting on the gun should be aligned properly. A detail that just makes you think the rest of it is probably equally shoddy. 5. Gun wands could all use some sort of flat section so they don't roll down your driveway while you're getting it ready and putting it away. Tiring to have to figure out where your wand went again. 6. Trigger handle did require more pressure to keep engaged than expected and I'm no wimp. Shut off a few times when I slightly relaxed my hand. Might be tiring for people with weaker hands. Other than that there wasn't anything I didn't like about the actual usage/pressure/etc. It does the job well once you're using it. It just annoys you setting it up and putting it away. It's fairly quiet and the wands work well. I really like the adjustable one. It has some serious power on the strongest single stream setting so be careful. Overall I got what I paid for. Maybe the more expensive ones have better setup/ergonomics but this one works and was cheap.",

The AR383 is significantly smaller and lighter. The high pressure hose reel is an advantage. Unfortunately you have to disconnect the high press hose from the unit to use the reel. The tool storage is better than the Karcher. I wish the Blue Clean had a rack for storing the power chord. It is cheaper than the Karcher ($150 ten years ago) and cheaper than an equivalent Karcher replacement. I found the Karcher to be unreliable after the latest failure I decided to junk it. I hope the AR is better. I did not have the same leakage problems at the inlet that other people report. I bought the brass double female hose adapter anyway.",

Relatively quite (less noise than a vacuum cleaner) Low water use (I even use a cheap 1/4 diameter hose on it at 1.5 GPM rating) Works well with the round flat surface cleaner (optional) Cons: Not interchangeable with other machines (like my $69 Husky electric that is 15 years old now) GFCI plug is understandable, but it won't fit in many outdoor outlets.

I cleaned 500 sf of concrete porch and pea gravel decks with the option deck cleaner (a 12\" round attachment that has a law sprinkler head under it, with high pressure nozzles. it spins while cleaning to minimize streaking). Plenty of pressure to keep it going, and when you let go, the motor shuts off. There is one odd quirk I noticed. When I let go the first time, the motor make a different sound and seems to go to a lower power setting. Nothing about that in the manual, not sure if it's a feature or a bug. But, the second time I squeeze, the motor goes to full power. !?!?",

I've cleaned the hot tub, got the moss off the bricks (watch out for loose mortar!), scared the cats and the ice chests look like new. I did find though that our house water pressure might be a bit close to the threshold that this unit needs. My first attempts at using the unit ended up in it acting fairly sporadic, sputtering a bit every couple of minutes. That went away when I opened up the water faucet _all_ the way, which was less than one more half turn. The car sponge reference in the title happened when I went to wash the truck today. Soap on, let sit, swap for the high pressure wand, and blast it! Hmmm... still dirty, but the dirt looks cleaner. I tried it a couple of times, using more soap and/or letting it sit longer, get _right up_ on the truck during the rinse cycle. Nada. In the end, I used the unit as an automated soap applier for my manual sponging, then a \"you better best bet all the soap's gonna be gone!\" rinse cycle. Now, on the upside in auto-washing, I have a \"project truck\" that's been in the driveway for, umm, a while. It has (had!) moss growing on it. I fired up the high pressure wand, and had a \"blast\" getting all the moss off of it. Way cool! A couple of other things to point out... - Like everyone else, get that bronze hose adapter that Amazon says \"also bought with...\" - The manual is horrible - the pictures are WAY too small. But, a couple of minutes spent sitting with the pieces and you'll figure it out. - The soap bags are bit too large to just drop into the canister, use a screwing motion and they'll go in. - DO NOT LOSE THE MAGIC CLEANING PIN! When using the soap canister, I didn't wait quite long enough for the soap bags to fully dissolve, and the remains got sucked up into the hose, and into the intake venturi. The hose was easy (but the soap tastes HORRIBLE!) but the venturi needed a jab with the cleaning pin. Even after, the venturi got clogged a couple of times in the hour I spent washing the truck. - If you find that the unit isn't providing full pressure, and the motor sounds \"weird\", grab the magic cleaning pin again and clean the nozzle of the wand you're using. The unit detects too much back pressure and the motor shifts into a protection mode. - If you quickly click-on/click-off, the unit will go into low pressure mode. You have to let the motor wind all the way down before clicking-on again in order to get high pressure mode. - The hose reel is useless. Just coil the power cord and the hose around the handle.",

The motor operated only when you pulled the trigger. This was a plus for me because it minimized excess noise and was more energy efficient overall. The pressure generated was quite robust with the turbo wand attached. It could easily washed off all the hardened tar, oil and excess mortar mix cement from my front driveway. The other wand could be adjusted to generate a wide spray pattern to wash your car or other situations requiring mild to moderate pressure cleaning. Now for the bad. Yes, even when I attached the connectors as instructed to my garden hose it leaked. Rather than buying extra parts such as brass connectors/adapters as others suggested, I did something much simpler. I stacked up two rubber washers where the fitting connects to the garden hose and viola...no more leaks. Hope this helps. Overall, I think this was a great purchase and plan to use more of it in the future... Update (4/20/15): After owning this pressure for 3+ yrs with very infrequent use (maybe once or twice a year), something broke. The o-rings from the hose to wand and wand to lancets cracked and broke at the worst time when I need to start a project going. Without an intact o-ring, the two pieces will not stay joined and you will not be able to operate the pressure washer without water leaking or splashing. These are cheap o-rings. Luckily, Amazon carries replacement o-rings kit with measurements listed. I just take note of the size and bought replacement at the local hardware stores for cheap. Would have been nice if company had thrown in a couple of these o-rings...",

Of course, this is not as powerful as a gas powered washer, but there are a lot of benefits! For one, its light and easy to get around. I can easily put it in the back of my car if I need to. It is fairly quiet (compared to the big gas ones), which to me is a big deal because my young kids are usually outside playing when I am using this, and I like to be able to hear what they are up to. It does a really good job cleaning. It gets almost everything out of the brick, stucco and concrete. However, I do spray a water and bleach mix onto the surface I plan to clean, about 30 minutes prior to cleaning. That really helps. Without that step this washer would not get everything up, but it only takes a few extra minutes. (Side note - I found that the bleach/water mix works far better than the pressure washer cleaning solutions, but you have to be careful not to get it on your plants and grass, etc) It also works really good on cleaning cars, especially the tires, and you do not have to worry about damaging anything. Bottom line, its a great buy, easy to use, easy to move around and durable. Ive had it for over two years and use it several times a month, and never had a single issue with it. It is one of the best cleaning items I have ever bought.",

I got an email response within 10 minutes from the rep at AR Blue Clean! He says a new unit will ship to me today. Based on that extremely fast and courteous response I have already received I am changing my rating from a 1 to a 3! Even thought the unit was broken, I am impressed with their response so far. Original review -- I received the AR Blue Clean from Amazon on time. I took it out of the box today and began to put it together. I attached the accessory holder. Then I went to attach the pressure hose. Well....the connector on the main unit was bent in the shape of a \"D\" and there was no way it was going to connect. Not a good sign of quality control in manufacturing! I just called AR Blue Clean at the toll free number and spoke to someone for maybe a minute. I just sent them a copy of my Amazon receipt and a picture of the damaged part. Now I am waiting to see how long it will take to get the unit replaced. I really wanted to use it today too!

I didn't need a super powerful 3000 psi gas power pressure washer (trust me a bought one and is was too much for what I needed). I just needed something small, not too expensive, with enough power to wash my car. I also needed enough psi, as I am attaching an MTM Foam Gun (its a device that attaches to end pressure washer and filled with shampoo, foams up the car really nice). People complain about leaking...but anytime I work with a water hose, I use brass quick connects and teflon tape. That way you don't have to worry about leaks. Pro: 1. Super long power cord 2. Not heavy, easy to move around 3. On demand pump (which is great, so it only runs when you squeeze the trigger) 4. Plenty of power (1900 psi) for what I need it for Cons: 1. AR does not use universal type connections for their pressure washers. So if you are going to attached...lets say a MTM Foam gun you will need an adapter 2. The wind up wheel is ok...basic, not the greatest design, but it works. On a side note, if you plan on using an MTM Foam Gun or any other type of foam gun you will need an adapter. (the one supplied with this unit is poor). The good thing about AR is that they are now set up in North America and through their website can find any adapter or replacement part you will need. I have to say their customer service was GREAT, the office here in the states is located in Minnesota (great folks, super nice) Overall, I am very pleased with purchase, good value for the money for an electric pressure washer.",

The hose, connectors, wands and gun all feel extremely cheap. If I ere to drop this from a ladder at say 6 feet, I doubt it would survive. Which is fine, because it's what I paid for. The connectors from hose to washer are just cheap plastic. You can pick up brass from Home Depot for about 10 bucks. I have buyers remorse a bit and wish I got the gas from Costco, but then again, it was twice the price. I washed my walk way, drive way and front side walk with it. It did a good job. No real complaint from the functionality. I'll be doing the side molding in the backyard this weekend and expect it will get the mold on the part of the house that is in perpetual shade. I highly recommend you buy this if you're looking for a solid low end device. But upgrades will probably cost you about 60 bucks for an actual pressure hose, not a cheap plastic one and brass connectors. Also, be warned, the deck washer you can get as a an attachment does not fit - wish I knew ahead of time - but the adapter is not on Amazon, that I could see at least.

            "review_text": "Overall, a great power washer. The PSI is great for an electric unit, powerful enough to clean cement, cars, house exteriors, etc. I chose 4 stars instead of 5 for a few reasons: -Mobility while connected. The garden hose attaches to the front, the power cord comes out of the back, and the pressurized hose comes out of the back. When moving, any twisting motion seems like it is going to put excessive stress on the garden hose connection and possibly break it. It connects with plastic instead of copper. Despite others saying the garden hose intake leaks, mine leaked at first, but then I tightened it up (by hand) and didn't have any problems going forward. - Non universal connections. I bought this primarily for car cleaning, and wanted to use the MTM Foam Cannon. You can use it, however you need to order a special adapter that lets you connect to 1/4\" connections. They sell this adapter, but you have to call and order. It isn't on the website for some reason. The part number is: \"PW3084200 1/4\" bayonet adaptor\" -AR Blue sells a Foam Cannon that is made by the same people as the MTM Foam Cannon. I purchased this from their website, but shipping was slow and cost $18. The Foam cannon itself is reasonably priced @ ~$60. -Wish the hose was longer. 20 Ft. seems OK, but when you figure most cars are about 18' feet long, you'll need to move it around a few times to get all corners of the car. Not a big deal, and something that can be replaced/upgraded. -Aside from these few quirks, which may or not apply to your intended uses, I really like the unit. The adjustable angle end on the gun is GREAT and way better than the stupid variable angle tips that other pressure washers use. If you are cleaning something that is stubborn, you can simply twist the end of the gun and narrow the stream to make it MUCH more powerful. Careful not to cut your foot off if you focus it into a laser-geyser thin stream!!! -The unit is small, lightweight, and takes up very little space in the garage. I would suggest this for anybody that has wanted to use a powerwasher for home tasks. The price is right, customer service is decent, and the unit runs as advertised!",

Not to mention, renting you have to get as much done as you can before you have to bring it back. This machine worked great to strip off old flaking stain. You have to get pretty close to the siding, but that's okay, I have more control over it this way, so no damaged wood. I was actually really surprised as most things I read seemed to say 2300 psi or more for paint prep. In my situation, this has been enough. Maybe a bit more power would be nice, but this got the job done and for the price, it's an incredible value and I am so happy I bought this. As others have mentioned, getting the brass fitting was necessary, the factory one leaked. My brass did at first, but I think I had it too tight. So I took it off, put some Vaseline on the washers and just made it snug, and now NO LEAKS! Gilmour 7FHS7FH Double Female Swivel Brass Connector, 3/4-Inch by 3/4-Inch For power washing my siding I bought the AR brand 25' extension. That was nice. I could go all the way up the ladder and all across the back of my house without having to move the pressure washer, that was so convenient. If you are doing a job that requires you to wash a larger areas, like the length of a house, or up a high ladder I highly recommend the extension hose. AR North America 25-Feet Extension Hose So there you have it, I think this is a great value and the machine is doing a great job for me. If you have not used a power washer before, just know some things require patience while you let the pressurized water do the work. You do have to work close and in small sections, so sometimes it's slow going. I think the tradeoff would be a very expensive gas unit though, and the higher pressures can also do damage (if you are not careful). For the money, I got more than I expected and can highly recommend this unit.",

It is powerful enough to use on the house siding but won't take off paint unless its already flaking. Just follow the directions and stand back so the pressure isn't so high. This is a great washer for simple home owner tasks. The machine is light and sturdy. I was worried that the plastic valve that connects the hose to the washer was not going to hold up so I purchased an extra one. I have dragged this machine around many times and have not had any problems at all. It performs exactly as advertised and it is very simple to use. My 13 year old can handle it with no problems.",

There was a noticeable layer of fungus growth and this made my area look like the cement was just installed! I did get the extended warranty as I felt that it was worth the extra coin since I don't see it breaking in the first year as it most likely will only be used an additional 3 maybe 4 more times this year?

When you wrap the power cable, you'll end up wrapping it on top of the soap dispenser. The hooks that hold the two pressure washer wands seem to be a bit too small. I'm already seeing some stress marks in the plastic because the wands are too thick. Overall, this pressure washer has been reliable and has been up to the task.

I'm 66 yrs. young and I worked on cleaning the concrete \"off & on\" over the course of 4 days. Two wand attachments are included.....a tight spinning circular \"turbo\" spray (I used this on the concrete) and an adjustable sprayer which is very powerful as well (from a wide \"fan\" spray, it can be adjusted to a very, very tight \"pin-point\" spray....capable of cutting diamonds....I exaggerate ;-) to stress the power of this adjustment point). This pressure washer and its soap dispenser, which attaches to the high pressure hose both performed excellently!! The soap is broadcast as a gentle foam spray in a \"fan\" shape. I like that the soap doesn't travel thru the interior of the machine, potentially \"... gumming it up\". I've owned a 1600 psi Karcher and an 1800 psi Husky, but this AR Blue Clean AR383 pressure washer has out-performed both, so far. Long term durability?? I can't say yet.

After getting it out and using it, I don't think I' m too worried about that; at least for now. Assembly was fast and easy with the Quickstart guide, and I used the regular manual just to double-check some operational stuff. I had some funny looks from my family, but I went out and used it under my covered patio during a rain shower anyway. There are two different wands included, and they are very easy to swap out. I didn't use the soap dispenser this time, but will try it on my truck sometime when it quits raining so much here. One is like a water laser, but it is good for stuff on concrete and other surfaces that is stuck pretty badly. The other is adjustable, and was good for cleaning the concrete. I'm didn't buy the round concrete wand yet, but I have used one before on another power washer and will probably do so in the near future before tackling a larger project like the driveway. Overall it was really easy to use and easy (and compact) to store afterwards. The spindle for the hose seems OK to me, and maybe the hose was changed from some of the other reviewers as this one didn't seem to be permanently curled. It was also not too noisy, but it does take some getting used to. When you release the trigger on the wand, the unit shuts off, but if you squeeze it too quickly after releasing it, like to change hands, it seems to sputter for a second. Just let it sit for a couple of seconds and it will go again. I'm happy with it the one time I have used it so far! It was also cheaper on Amazon than at Home Depot.",

The adjustable nozzle doesn't work very well, not as strong/clean stream as the replaceable nozzles you see on other machines. 2. The instructions are good, but you might need a magnifying glass :-) 3. The turbo nozzle is ok, not sure if it's better than the equivalent pressure nozzle, but it makes an annoying sound on the pavement, like high pitched and irritating. 4. The winding thing designed to contain the hose just isn't really practical. You have to disconnect the hose, then shove it in there and wind it, once it's wound you think, ok cool, but that wasn't worth the work. However, unwinding doesn't work at all, the handle doesn't help, you just need to pull the thing yourself. 5. the wand is a little short, you find yourself bending down 6. The wands don't really 'snap' into place in the back holder, there's no leverage to push them in all the way so they stay, so you either need to get on your kneed and suport the machine while trying to shove them in (which doesn't work) or you need to put the machine on its belly and whack them, but then you could break the hose nozzle that sticks out the front. So these don't really work either. 7. Ok power cord can be wound around the back, cool right ? not really... you wind it around 75% but then you have plenty of cord left ... doesn't fit any more so you need to figure something else out. Overall lots of \"want to be useful\" features that aren't as practical in execution. I'm either going to get better wands or return this machine and get something more expensive that's also more practical. Pros: 1. pretty quiet machine 2. long power cord 3. the wands suck, but they're convenient :-) 4. the black pressurized rubber hose is pretty flexible and doesn't kink or tangle easily, better than other hoses I've used.",

The biggest issue I have is that the pressure hose is so rigid, it is very hard to move the unit around. There is the hose feed and the electrical line as well, and they will get tangled. The wheels are useless because of this as well. The pressure hose is also very difficult to reel back, and once you get it wound nice and tight, it will spool out a bit and become loose, due to the nature of the hose rigidity. As for the recommendations for a brass fitting, I still have the OEM fittings and they work fine. I have had to replace the gaskets that fit on each attachment, and the pressure hose as well. Even as lower pressure, it can still cause damage when used with a jet tip, so be careful. It can easily damage wood, plastic, even asphalt. There are very few uses for the jet tip, I use the adjustable fan wand usually. The soap mixer is okay pretty basic. I bought a separate foam lance and use it to wash my truck, major difference in foam thickness. I use it to foam the truck to let dirt loosen, then I switch to my garden hose to rinse. I paid $150, so at $110 on 4/11/16, this is pretty good deal. But if you think cords a problem for other things, this will drive you nuts. I am saving already for a gas powered unit, usually about $275, and I can say the ease of use alone would make those a better choice overall.",

I have a large deck that I power wash every spring with a Briggs and Stratton 2150 PSI gas model. It is very loud on goes through about 1 gallon of gas per washing of the deck. I thought that having an electric model would be sufficient. Shipping was lighting fast and assembly was simple. Within 5 minutes of unboxing, I had it plugged in and washing. I quickly realized that it was not a very powerful unit. We have a teak dining set and this unit struggled to spray off the winter dirt that that gas unit would blast right off. I also tried this AR383 on my driveway. It would only do very small(2-3\") strips and would have taken me many hours to clean the cement. I did a side by side test of the old Briggs model I had been using and there was no comparison. While gas is loud, you can always keep the motor further away to keep down the noise. I do think the AR Blue clean is a great product for light use. It is not powerful enough to do a decent job on decks or concrete. If you are the type of person that owns many power tools and appreciate the value of using the right tool for the job, this is not the tool for you. This tool is constructed very well and is a high quality plastic.The proprietary fittings were a bit disappointing and would have like to see a standard brass quick connect included. I would recommend this for washing your car, vinyl siding, or maybe general outdoor cleaning that would need pressure more powerful than a hose. The attached soap bottle is very handy and nice that you could swap it for another attachment in the middle of a job. I also like the hose quick connect so much that I bought one for the new power washer that I eventually purchased.Since this is a 14 OR 15 amp electric model, I doubt that you will be able to find a 110V plug-in power washer with much more power. From what I have read, this unit is as powerful as the higher end consumer Karcher models. My suggestion to AR would be to make the hose reel diameter larger or get rid of it all together. The hose reel is cumbersome and would have likely not used it had I kept this tool. In short, I returned this AR Blue Clean AR383 back to Amazon and UPS shipping was free. I am unsure if this is because I am a Amazon Prime subscriber or standard policy. I ended up purchasing a gas power washer at Home Depot. It is 2200 PSI and fitted with standard attachments. It works great for my purposes and made quick work of the deck and the driveway. Although I will likely only use a power washer a few times a year, I like to have the right tool for the job when I need it. To me that is worth another $100.",

Once it failed (on the first usage!), it wouldn't allow enough water to flow to the pump causing constant cavitation. You can roll up the pressure hose once you're done, but you have to disconnect it from the wand and the machine - there's a special clip that the end fits into, then just straighten the hose out and reel up.

There's a real problem here. The unit I purchased came with a 14 tpi male hose inlet. That is a British or European hose spec. American garden hose is a 11.5 tpi spec. \"The thread standard for garden hoses in the United States and its territories is known as GHT or \"garden hose thread\", which has an outer diameter of 1 1\u204416 inches (26.99 mm) and a pitch of 11.5 TPI2.2 mm; parallel thread (non-tapered).

Anyways, trying to put an American GHT connector on the unit I had resulted in massive leaking; it just wouldn't screw on very far or seal properly. I'm looking to find a BSP to GHT adaptor, but so far no luck.

I will be repurchasing some other brand with the money. This model has known issues, but if you got stuck with one, the answer is \"too bad, so sad\".

            "review_text": "I am a 62 year old woman who is not mechanically inclined and not strong. I purchased this pressure washer primarily to clean my composite deck/screened in porch and patio furniture and the lower portion of the siding on my house. It was relatively simple to put together even for me. it is lightweight enough that I was able to use it for several hours with no problems. In my opinion, only the turbo attachment is of any use. The detergent bottle has less pressure than my garden hose and the spray wand would be fine for washing a car. The turbo wand was not too powerful for the composite deck and did a good job cleaning it as well as the siding. It will hurt you though and I held it too close to the door frame for too long and a small chip of paint came off.However, you have to hold the wand close to the siding to get enough power so that means it is not useful for cleaning the second story. For my purposes it is perfect and easy to maneuver. I will rent a more powerful washer to have my son remove the paint from the front porch and wash the second story of the house. I ordered from Amazon and had it in 12 hours. I did break off the blue tab where the power hose connects to the machine when I was disconnecting and have to contact customer service . That was my fault. Also you cannot wrap up the electrical cord first and then try to put on the attachments because they won't fit. First put on the attachments and then wrap the cord. Pros Inexpensive Easy to assemble Long power cord No leaks, now comes with quick connect Compact for storage Cons The electrical cord, power hose and garden hose get tangled easily Not enough power to strip paint off a full size deck I wish I could lock it in place when the trigger is on. Will update after I contact customer service",

It cleaned 5 years of grunge off of my brick patio quickly and has enough control that I wasn't damaging the mortar. It's pretty quiet, and doesn't seem to have thermal issues--I used it continuously for over an hour in 90+ degree heat. I recently got a patio cleaner accessory that supposidly cleans better and stops spray bouncing up and getting windows dirty, but I haven't tried it yet. A lot of thought went into the storage capabilites--everything has a place (except the paperclip-size cleanout thing) and things stay where they're put. Negatives: Only one--the odd plastic water inlet adapter fitting other reviewers have mentioned. Hasn't broken yet, but I worry about it. Highly recommended for the average homeowner. Small, light, quiet, does a great job and comes at a reasonable price.",

I don't think that I would want an electric washer with any less power (1900 PSI, per the mfgr.), even just for around the home and yard jobs, but for cleaning patios, cars, outdoor furniture, and stuff like that this is good enough. The cord provided is a generous length, and the hose is adequate. I didn't encounter any problems with the garden hose coupler that have been reported by some users, although the plastic design probably won't prove to be robust. I'd give this at 4 stars if the ergonomics were better. The reel provided at the top of the case is too clunky to use, and if one did use it for the hose the tight coils that it would cause in the stiff hose would make the hose hard to handle until the coils relaxed. As designed, the reel is not usable for the cord, either, and no good holder for the cord is provided. The plastic caddy provided for the wands and detergent bottle is not very effective, either, since the clips that have to be used for one of the wands don't hold it very well. A better case would make this a handier tool, and complement its good cleaning functionality.",

The deck is about 4 years old and has never been stained or treated so it was starting to look pretty weathered. I was amazed at the results! By the time I finished power washing it (even with 4 yrs of crud on it, I did not need to use any chemical cleaners) it looked like new wood. I allowed it to dry, coated it with some Thompsons and it looks like new. I have since power washed a side of my house that gets moldy each spring, my pool deck, and the grates from my grill. I found this pressure washer to be more than powerful enough to handle any job I've given it. It is pretty lightweight and easy to use. I read some reviews that had concerns about leaking connections and inadequate storage space for the electrical cord, I did not have either of these issues with my pressure washer. Storing the pressure hose on the little hose real is a little time consuming but doable. Personally, after the first couple uses, I found it easier to just loop the pressure hose around the top handle for storage.I will gladly recommend this unit to anyone looking for a pressure washer to help them with those tougher cleaning jobs around the home. Very reasonably priced and nicely made.",

Wash cars, boat, boat carpet, engine compartments, tin roofs, etc. The only feature I dont like is the hose reel. For winter storage it is fine, but for everyday use and storage you have to remove the hose assembly, wind it all up. If you didnt have to remove the hose from the washer it would be great, but you do. It pretty much worthless and could be removed or improved. Secondly, the nozzle storage clips on the back are not secure enough for general usage. As your moving around, washing, etc, the nozzles will fall off, not a big deal, but could be improved.

I bought this AR North America AR383 electric washer hoping it would be less hassle to use and its 1,900 PSI capacity would not be all that much less powerful than the gas one. Actually, my gas washer has Zero PSI at the moment. Anyhow, the electric power washer did not disappoint. It was easily powerful enough for the tasks I had for it today. Frankly, I thought it was very similar to the power my gas machine produced the last time I had it running. The extensive research I did on these electric power washers took me to the AR383 as I passed over the yellow one, the green one and the Costco `snappy' one. I even rejected electric washers that claimed to be slightly more powerful and a couple that were cheaper. The AR383 was priced right for what it offers and had the features I thought were the most important. I got the deck cleaned off. It was not all that dirty, but had a little algae and mold on it from the winter weather. The electric washer did a good job with that. I also got the metal garden shed cleaned of lots of algae and dirt and the machine performed well with that as well. The work on the shed went a little bit slower than it did with the gas washer last year, but quickly none the less. I tried out the detergent applicator to speed things up and was not all that impressed with it. It works OK, but a squirt bottle or a pump up garden sprayer full of deck wash would probably do as well. As it turned out, I really didn't need to apply the detergent anyhow. The power washer did the job nicely without any Chemical help. The thing I like best about the new electric power washer is how the motor and pump shut down when the trigger on the wand is released. It is also relatively quiet and does not leak. The electric wire is pretty long, but I had to use a short heavy duty extension cord to get the washer close enough to the garden shed way out in the backyard, but that was no problem really. The high pressure hose is a squirmy snake like all of these things are and it tangles once in awhile, but I suppose that is a nuisance to be endured with power washers. The overall quality built into this machine is quite good. Do I like my AR North America AR383 electric washer? You bet I do.",

I own multiple lawn machines (mowers, weed trimmers, etc.) that have a gas engine and I honestly did not want one more piece of equipment that needs gas and has to be serviced and winterized every year. I wanted something I can pull out for use when I am ready and little to zero maintenance. 2. Lower pressure was okay. I am a homeowner and I detail cars on the side. I do not need 3000 psi like your typical gas pressure washer. I just dont. I needed something to help make detailing easier as well as something that can clean my siding and my deck. This does that with ease. 3. I didn't want to break the bank. As I said in #1, I didn't want gas. Sure a homeowner oriented unit may only cost another $100-$200 dollars, but then I need to consider the fuel use and maintenance. I have not spent a dime past purchasing this unit since getting it 6 months ago. Unlike other users, my hose hookup connector does not leak. But even if it did, and considering the price of the unit, I can suck up a couple dollars for something like that.

The overall build quality is decent for this price range -- about what you'd expect from a Black & Decker tool, for whatever that's worth to you. Getting it put together took less than five minutes, including the time it took to grab a phillips screwdriver. Everything sealed perfectly, and I was washing my siding in no time. The included gun and wands are enough for most homeowners, but the detergent bottle was a bit of a let down. I would have really appreciated a way to use detergent with the wands, or something that holds more detergent. This bottle is pretty tiny (it might hold 8 ounces or so) and you have to get really close to what you're cleaning to use it. Luckily, the company makes some reasonably-priced accessories that I think will work better for using detergent. For the price, it's nice to have around the house washing your car, patio, siding, and stuff like that. I wouldn't use it to start a business with, but I'd expect to get several years out of it for home use.",

I didn't want a gas operated washer because I didn't want to deal with purchasing gas and maintaining the engine (spark plugs, air and oil filters, gas conditioners to maintain the carburetor, oil changes etc...) + a gas operated pressure washer leaves exhaust smoke behind. You would inhale a big deal of it while working. I tried it a couple of times and i really didn't like it. They sure have more power, but this little one does the job well... It's a little machine but powerful. I purchased this in April of 2013 for $160 even with free shipping. The price of this same product was then reduced to $150 and then back up again and back down again. I hate it when amazon changes prices like a yoyo... I don't understand the purpose of it and they change prices every single day on different items that i have saved in my cart. I used this pressure washer a few hours every day. I used it to wash my cars + engines (4 cars). You have to adjust the nozzle to reduce the pressure impact on fragile components. It is powerful enough to do damage. So be careful when washing car engines. I used it to wash the driveway and the porch (cement). I washed my electrical lawn mower specially the underneath. I also used it to wash away ant mounts :-) No leaks, no problem. (for people who complain about leaks, try to use teflon around the connections.) When I'm done with washing, I disconnect all hoses and use my air hose to push away any remaining water from inside the pump. If I want to store it for the winter, I spray some WD-40 in the pump to keep it lubricated. There are special lubricants for these pumps to extend its life, but I think, my way of lubricating it is good enough. I spray it from the front and air hose it to push the lubricant all around the pump then out... The cons? Well, when I'm washing the underneath of the car, the wand is too long and can't be bent to reach right where you want it. I guess I will have to purchase a smaller wand for that purpose. By the way, I never used the turbo wand because it didn't adjust like the other wand and it wasn't as powerful as the other one.

(Continued from above) - the placement of the hose input is on the front of the unit, while the electrical plug is on the back of the unit, so it creates more hose/wire clutter around the unit since they're in different directions. 3.

I can tell no difference between the AR pressure washer and the car wash, other than the quarters. I have used this pressure washer extensively, and although lightweight, it has held up wonderfully. It is well built with a good design. It comes with two high pressure wands, and a low pressure soap/solution dispenser. The solution dispenser is made of plastic, and is designed so whatever solution is used, does not enter the machine itself. This means that one can dispense somewhat corrosive solutions, such as chlorine, with damaging the machine. I highly recommend this machine, and consider it one of my better purchases.

I'll also agree with other reviewers on the hose reel and storage rack-- they are pretty much useless. After four years of light use, mine was still running ok, with the exception of the gun/wand. I had to replace the gun when the unit was about 14 months old because it was leaking like a sieve from every screw hole. It then proceeded to explode in my hands while I was using it. Replacement parts are available, so I purchased a new one. Worked fine, until the gun started leaking again when I pulled it out this spring. Just not worth having to replace parts all the time.

The sad thing about it is the design of the machine, the on and off switch is hidden in back and very hard to push, why not have a simple toggle switch right in front easy to use, secondly, the power cord bracket is placed right where you attach the pressure hose so you cant put the power hose on unless you remove all the power cord, you should put two brackets on the side of the machine to wind up the power cord. Thirdly, that accessory brackets on the power cord bracket are stupid, you cannot snap the pressure attachment into that bracket to save your soul and they won't stay there. Someone did not use their head when they designed the machine and probably did not try it out. It is a shame to sell a product like this without thought behind the design.",

I took it out last week (November 30th....just 8 months after I bought it) and it does not work!. The unit does not power up. The fuse in the unit's plug is not popped, and the socket(s) are fine. Initially, it made a small pumping noise when first turned it on (like it was going to run), then nothing. Now, it makes no noises at all. The plug's EFI fuse is still in too. I read the trouble shooting guide.....nothing. Amazon will not accept it back for refund (I have tried and the website will not allow me to advance beyond the 1st screen saying it is too late). TOO LATE! So, $200+ for an item that worked one time then quit for no reason. Needless to say I was unhappy. Then (while filling in my rating of the product) I read another review and the Amazon customer recommended calling the company directly at 866-235-5112. I did, and the friendly (and surprisingly knowledgeable) person on the other end of the phone listened to my issues. They walked me through a number of potential issues that COULD be keeping the motor from coming on. I did the simple repairs/maintenance that she recommended and....what do you know....it all works fine now. I'll hope for the best and that it keep working, but top marks to the company for having a good product support division. They even offered to replace it for free it kept failing to work, I just needed my AMAZON receipt as proof of purchase! AND, the consumer help people are real Americans working IN THE USA, not....someplace else.",

The unit arrives partially assembled, but goes together fast and optionally tears down for storage or cleaning just as quickly. Four screws attach two plastic attachments in the back to handle accessories and rolling up the cabling. Pressure hose from unit to trigger-handle connects quickly, and the trigger mechanism has two different wands. The adjustable wand works great for me, haven't tried the \"turbo wand\" that is also included... The adjustable wand allows easily moving from powerful jet (capable of drilling a hole in limestone; be careful!) to a softer fan that is useful for cleaning decks, driveways, etc. The electric pump works as described, providing an endless stream of powerful water spray, or with a double-pull of the trigger will provide a gentle spray for a temporary clean-up of your hands. No leaks whatsoever on first and second uses... ran for many hours cleaning the pool deck, stone stairs, driveway, etc. When you let go of the trigger, the water stops. No leaks at the wand, trigger, pressure hose connections, or garden hose intake. Really impressive. Not sure why some other people complained about the clear-plastic adapter and leaks; no problems experienced here. Just be careful to ensure the parts that screw together are lined up properly to keep the threads aligned, as you should do with any equipment that screws together. The electric pump is not so loud that earplugs are needed, certainly less noise than a gas-powered unit. Note - given the adjustable wand that is included, I don't see any real need to buy different tips to create alternate sprays. The adjustable wand should meet most homeowner needs.",

            "review_text": "As a starter, the only reason I purchased this pressure washer was because my OLD little 1400 PSI Karcher which I used for over 12 years got flooded with seawater from storm Sandy. Never had a problem with the Karcher which was used by myself, neighbors and family. Thought I would upgrade and purchased the AR383 and had problems straight away. The electric cord rewind was very difficult to use, jammed and finally I just wind the cord around the top handles which I still do. I used the machine very sparingly in the first year, maybe 6-8 time for minor jobs. Then the machine died. it would start for a few seconds and then just kick off. I found the GFI breaker plug was kicking off which would tell me there was a short somewhere in the machine. I called customer service and a very knowledgeable man walked me thru some trouble shooting and we determined the only thing that may be wrong was the GFI. I bypassed the GFI and the machine worked fine. The machine was just 3 or 4 weeks past the one year warranty and not covered so a new plug from the manufacturer was about $20 so I took it off permanently. Next the pressure hose connection going into the trigger assembly started to leak profusely. The two O-rings somehow can off the male connection and I had a had time finding exact replacements which are still not perfect and the connection still leaks a little but I just get wet a little when using the washer. Overall the actual pressure washing ability of the machine is fine, just too many problems for a machine that is hardly used. I need to buy another washer for a house in another state and I will not buy an AR. I will go back to Karcher and buy their 1800 PSI model and would not recommend AR.",

            "review_text": "We rented power washers before, and found them to be very effective for a variety of projects. We finally decided to research and purchase one and chose the AR383 1900psi. We chose that pressure as the rentals we had were all 2000psi, and that was more than enough for our needs. At that pressure it will effectively clean your deck, siding, grill, patio, etc. The AR was well rated, though I noted with some trepidation some of the issues it seemed to have with leakage. However, after reading the high praise for the service at AR, I decided to go ahead with the purchase. The AR383 comes in pieces, and I would recommend you sit down for 1/2 hour and put it together a couple of times. The first time I did it was rather confusing, but after the second time I no longer needed directions. When it is disassembled and stored, it consists of the main unit, a hose (which is not connected), two wands (wide pressure wash and focused pressure wash), an attachment you can use to wash your car/house that has room for a soap additive (and cuts down on the pressure a little), a clear connector that goes on the front, the 'gun', the electric cord, and a coupler to connect to your hose. All of it is well made and does not feel cheap. It is made of a heavier plastic so has some heft to it. To use it you connect you use the couple and screw one end on your garden hose. The other end is a pull back connector that goes on the unit itself on the front. You unwind the pressure washer hose (it is thinner than a regular hose to build up more pressure) and connect one end to the unit in the screwing it on in the back. The other end is a quick connect that clicks in to the 'gun'. The wands are push and turn, i.e., you line up the tabs on the wand, push it onto the gun, then push down and twist to lock it in place. You are now ready to go, just turn on your hose, plug it in, and press the 'on' button. I had absolutely no leakage issues. Every part fit securely, there were no drips or spray from any of the couplings. You will need to use a standard garden hose. DO NOT USE those popular shrink and contract hoses, as I split one in five places because the hose cannot handle the pressure. The better the hose you have, the better it will work. I have used both wands. The high pressure one is great for cleaning small areas that have heavy stains. The wider wand has enough pressure to use on a deck and the width of the spray makes it cover a wider area than the other wand. Though the wide wand lacks the higher pressure of the focused wand, it still has more than enough pressure to plow through tough concrete stains, siding dirt, etc. The electric cord is long enough to use in a normal yard without adding an extension cord, and the 20 ft. high pressure hose is adequate for the job. I have used this washer more than once and gotten great results. It did a tremendous job on the deck ( do not use the focused wand, as it can actually gouge the wood!), a great job on the concrete patio, and cleaned up our swingset and siding with ease. I have not yet used it for car washing (I get lazy sometimes), but I'm ready! Overall this is a well made, strong pressure washer that is at a fantastic price. This is a great deal for the money.",

I then checked Amazon and found that they had the unit for $30 less than the store site. Being Amazon Prime members, we could order it with free two-day shipping. It was too good to pass up. Once I started using it I realized what a bargain it is. It worked flawlessly. It is an electric unit, so I had to run an extension cord around the yard, but this was a small annoyance.

I also used it on our cement driveway and it did the job. I noticed when I was using different hoses that some worked fine with no leaks but one of them I couldn't get to connect correctly at all. This might be what is happening to others who complain about the connector not working. It might be their hose, or the area where they were working and they can't get the angle right. Also, those that said it didn't work after storing for a few months probably lost the pump during a freeze. Customer service for this company is also terrific. I called because a picture on our box showed an attachment that didn't come with the unit so they just sent me one for free. Can't beat that support. I highly recommend this pressure washer.

While this is no necessarily a problem it appears that this reduction was achieved by making all the visible components (case, wand, tool holder, gun, hoses etc.) down sized and constructed of lightweight materials. Probably the two most questionable design elements are the hose reel which others have noted as being not worth the trouble to use and the hose inlet. The inlet is composed of an inline water filter (clear plastic) and a plastic hose connector with a brass insert. While I did not the leakage problem noted by other reviewers these components are so exposed and fabricated of such non-robust materials that near term failure would be almost assured in any hard use situation. As far as performance goes this unit seems very comparable to other electric pressure washers in terms of power and utility.

The quick-connect adapter that I received had a manufacturing defect causing it not to screw on correctly with the hoseline 2. The hose reel on the pressure washer isn't setup correctly in way that would make the reel very usable during actual use 3. The bottle for detergent is pretty small & none of the adapters are really made for proper car washing Altogether, the deal killer was the quick-connect adapter. Because of this, I couldn't even test the unit when I received it since it was spraying water all over the place. According to other reviews, the customer service is supposed to be pretty good here, but when I contacted them about it they treated me as if I didn't know where to connect the quick-connect adapter. After responding to try and clarify the situation with the expectation of an expedient mailing of a new adapter, no representatives have responded for three days. In the end, I gave up on receiving the response and have gone to the nearest Lowe's for their adapter which fit the hose perfectly. The hose reel should be connecting from the middle of the reel or else it can't actually be used during operation. This is a problem by design. The operation manual doesn't specify how to put on the hose to the reel because it's really just a gimmick. You could try and use the reel for storage, but the way it's made it's way easier to just put the pressure hose line in a bag. I tried washing my car with the pressure washer the other day. After using my friend's washer, I figured this would be a pretty good experience. However, the detergent bottle that comes with the unit is extremely small and none of the spray adapters are really made for the car. It's actually recommended NOT to use the turbo sprayer for the car, but the adjustable spray would be way too strong as well. Overall, this unit could be 4-5 stars, but with the experience with customer service and the gimmick of a hose reel, I can't really recommend this unit over something much cheaper.",

I have owned 3000psi gas powered pressure washers in the past, and this thing cannot come close to that kind of power...but, do you really need that for cleaning some mud off a car or atv??? Also, who wants to mess with stabil and gummed up carburetors? I got tired of the gas units sitting for too long and never starting. This electric unit works great for its intended purpose and it does it at a very reasonable price. Didn't get 5 stars simply because it isn't PERFECT, but it's close. It's lightweight (wife can move it around with ease), runs pretty quite for a pressure washer, has plenty of power cord length, and has an adequate hose length. My one gripe however is targeted at the hose...it's got a somewhat cheap feel and it's pretty stiff - has a plastic feel to it as opposed to rubber - but it seems good enough for the job. Also, like I said it's only just adequate in length...would have been nice if it was about 6-8 feet longer, but it's OK as is. I can't walk all the way around the car with out running out of hose. No big deal though, just switch sides. Time will tell if this hose holds up well... I also really like the \"turbo\" nozzle that comes with this washer. It adds just a slight bit of \"wobble\" to the water stream which helps break up the mud and dirt. I like the idea that pulsating water, rather than BRUTE psi force, is what cleans off the dirt. Seems a little \"nicer\" to my machines. Overall, I am VERY happy with this purchase and would HIGHLY recommend this product for light-duty cleaning jobs. One last thing, others had mentioned in reviews that the hose adapter leaked water. I am happy to report that the new design is working just fine. Seals tightly against a rubber o-ring and the quick adapter side has o-rings inside as well, which results in no leaks!",

The connection at the unit requires many more turns of the connector than one might ordinarily expect. The users manual leaves a little to be desired. It is a better than average translation but some of the things is says one should do are very obviously out of order. An example would be placing the wands in the holder _before_ wrapping the power cord around the projections that hold it in place.

I tightened first again by hand, then with the leverage of some vice grips. (Slight pressure, it's plastic). That made no difference. I attached the additional one that Amazon recommended and that made no difference as well. I am returning the unit immediately with great disappointment with the maker of the unit. (I did try to call them and got no answer. To be fair, it was on Saturday). There are many washers out there... Do yourself a favor and buy something other than the AR383.",

I also purchased the 25' hose extension which lets me cover much more area without moving the washer. Make sure you prime the pump by running water through it before you turn it on. For a little over $100, I have already saved what it would have cost me to rent a washer for 3 days and don't have to hurry to get it back to the store or buy gas, etc. The washer has a 1 year \"bumper to bumper\" warranty so I feel like I will be ok for at least that time.",

            "review_text": "I have had an electric power washer for about 9 years and used it primarily for cleaning the house siding, deck cleaning (fiberon synthetic), dock cleaning (pressure treated wood), and the dreaded patio furniture. It was a brand no longer available so when it died I researched several and was about to buy at the local Channel or Lowes when I saw this one on Amazon with good ratings and a great price relative to others of similar design. It has a similar engine design to the one I had that lasted so long so gave it a shot. It works great. Be prepared to replace the hose fitting on the body with brass because it looks like a good tip over and it'll break. I buy and use quick connects for ease. There's a fair amount of stress at the hose connection because of the weight of a hose and pulling the unit along. I have had no problems but why wait? Go get brass quick connect fitting(s) at your local H/Ware store. Bring the one attached to the unit with you, and get it before it breaks and you're stuck leaving your job to go find them when you're shoes are all wet. The suds unit attachment is basically worthless and they should just forget it and reduce the price. I had hoped it would be great for the car but there are other simpler \"hose only\" attachments you can buy that work fantastically well and outperform this thing by a wide margin. (See Chemical Guys online). That's the main reason for 4 stars. I did not expect gas powered performance and am very happy with this unit size, weight and performance. The wands work very well and the fan sprayer is great for reducing pressure when you need less. It's also ALOT lighter than my last one of similar size making it easier to move around and lug back and forth in the car if needed.",

The plastic hose connection works easily with no leaks.

I would not buy it without this tool which is exceptional on flat surfaces and cuts the cleaning time roughly in half. It has more than adequate pressure for most jobs. I have not cleaned brick or concrete surfaces or had to use the high pressure nozzle, but I think it would be more than adequate. The unit is light and easy to pick up and move which is important to me because I have an upstairs deck and two balconies to maintain. My wife loves to use it also. We rent a house in SC in February and March with no garage and the pollen gets in every crevice of both cars. The AR Blue Clean removed every speck of it. I recommend it very strongly!",

            "review_text": "I was in the market for a pressure washer to wash my cars and motorcycle. I had been looking at gas powered ones when I decided to give the electrics a shot first. I have a very small garage so the extra bulk of a decent gas unit would've been a problem. The price also came into question. I was looking at $700-800 for the gas units I was considering. Then I started reading around and stumbled across some glowing customer reviews about this pressure washer. I decided to give it a shot. The worst that could happen is that I'd hate it and send it back. This thing is tiny compared to a gas power washer and its light. I had my doubts after unboxing it. I assembled it and ran outside to wash something. Wow! This thing sprays just as hard as the wands at the coin-op car wash! I think the best feature of his power washer is the on demand flow control. The unit only produces pressure when you squeeze the trigger on the wand. Perfect for washing cars. That way the unit won't burn itself up. Overall I'm very pleased with my AR Blue Clean. I only have two minor gripes with it though. The inlet and outlet locations are not very user friendly and too close to the ground. The output is in the back of the unit and the input is on the front. I'm thinking a tiny bit more engineering invested could put the hook ups higher and on the front or top of this unit or at the very least put the input on the back and output on the front. The supplied quick connect for the water supply is plastic and hit hangs off the front of the unit pretty far. If it ever gets hit or kicked its toast. The AR Blue Clean website does sell a much more durable brass connector($10) that's also compatible with the brass quick connects you can buy at the hardware store. Why didn't they just sell it with that to begin with? I do love this power washer for washing cars. It gets the job done nicely. Even though hooking it up is kind of quirky its still a crapload easier to whip out when you need it than having to hoss out a big heavy gas power washer, fuel it up, hook it up and then hoss it back inside. As a matter of fact it works so well my next door neighbor ordered on the very next week.",

I planned on getting another karcher because we were very pleased with its performance over the years. We primarily use the power washer to clean our lanai in florida. It's a concrete lanai with a rough surface and dirt gets caught in the crevices. We also get a lot of mildew, mold, etc from all the humidity. The AR383 Blue Clean just didn't clean the lanai as well as the Karcher had. Yes it worked better than a hose but not as well as the Karcher especially on stubborn stains. We have flower pots on lanai and after it rains dirt water drips out and stains around the pot. Well the AR383 Blue didn't hardly remove any of the stain. It also didn't totally remove the mildew/mold area either. I stood on top of the area for several minutes and nothing. I was so disappointed because this is the main reason I use the power washer. I suppose I will have to get a bucket and mop to get the stain that my Karcher use to get up with no problems. Anyway, I suppose the AR383 would be good for car washing but not any real stubborn stains. There are a few good points I can point out: 1) it is a lightweight machine, 2) quieter than Karcher, 3) smaller footprint 4) less expensive than Karcher. I don't feel like going through the hassle of sending it back so we will keep it until it stops working and replace it with a Karcher.",

When I broke the detergent bottle I called the company and they were nice enough to send me a replacement free. Of course it is not as powerful as a gas model but that's not all bad.

            "review_text": "For the price, this is a very good pressure washer. It's electric, so it's more convenient and quieter than a gas-powered model, but it also isn't as powerful, but for my purposes it has plenty of power. Our poured concrete back patio hadn't been washed/cleaned in the previous 5 years, and we have plenty of things contributing to it looking dirty - trees dropping sap and seeds, frequent gardening activities that track dirt and mud, three dogs that contribute their flotsam and jetsam, etc. I fired up this washer and after a few hours of work it was sparkling white and clean. I also used it on my Polywood outdoor furniture which, while it's relatively impervious to any permanent discoloration, had built up some surface dirt and grime and were looking dull. After a quick blast they looked like new. So, the good news is that this unit gets the jobs done that I need doing, and it does them conveniently and relatively quietly. The less good news is that it could use a few tweaks to make it better, in my estimation. First and foremost, the reel for the hose is a bit awkward. First of all, be sure you understand that you have to unwind the entire hose before use, so it's not like you can quickly pull out a couple feet of hose for a small job, you have to unwind the whole thing. Secondly, the diameter of the reel is such that the hose is wound pretty tightly given its relative stiffness, and when you unwind it the hose initially has a lot of leftover coiling that makes it inconvenient to move around the with the hose. The kinks eventually calm down, but having a kinky-curly hose is frustrating at first. Third, you also have to completely unwind the power cord before using the unit, because the designated storage winding area in the back places the cord such that it blocks access to the where the hose attaches to the body. Again, if you are doing a big job this isn't a huge deal, but it limits the ability to use the unit for quick jobs. Fourth, the unit has mounting points to hold all the provided attachments, which is good, however they do not hold them securely, such that any time the unit is moved or jostled there is a good chance of dislodging one or more attachments. However, the bottom line is that for the price this unit gets the job done. I would definitely recommend it, and have already purchased a second one as a gift. The cons listed above are more like small annoyances and I list them here just so any future buyers are aware of them.",

It is unusually quiet. No leaks at the usual places but time will tell. I've used it on my car, brick wall with mold and mildew and parts of my deck, full of mildew and it did a great job... no excellent job of cleaning it. Very impressed. So impressed I took of my clothes and sprayed myself and it took of 2 layers of skin and now I look 20 years younger but it's hard to sit down(just kidding had to put this disclaimer in case somebody really stupid would try it out that reads this!) My only criticism deals with the reel that rolls the hose up, the attachment holder and the placement of the attachment for the inlet hose but to do anything about it would call for a redesign which ain't going to happen. These are no deal breakers If you notice most electric power washers are based on this design so you will run into some of these annoyances on them, too. The thing I liked about this power washer is the company AR and it's customer service. I had a small problem with one of the wands and \"boom\" they took care of it immediately. There are two things to consider when buying a product, \"does it work\" and does the \"company stand behind it and takes care of you\" and this company does. They put out a great product and customer service is excellent. Kudos AR. You had me at \"Way I help you\" If you have any doubts about buying an AR electric pressure washer, \"Don't!\"",

Although it's not nearly as powerful as a gas powered one, it starts up every time and I haven't had to spend any time fiddling with a motor. I was mostly looking for something that could do some light cleaning of the house, wash the cars, and wash the driveway and garage floor. This fits the bill for all of them. I've also used this to wash reclaimed lumber... stripping off the old gray and making the wood look newer but still aged. If you are looking for something to strip paint I would look for something in the 3000 PSI and higher range. This thing can do it but it would take you forever and you have to have the nozzle adjusted to a fine point to get it to spray hard enough.",

Our old power washer died last year and I was unsure what to replace it with. Went to my favorite go-to source (Amazon) to read reviews, and as a result chose this power washer. After receiving it I had it assembled and was power washing in about 30 minutes. It's MUCH easier to use than my old model, which had to be primed and was very complicated as there was an exact order in which it had to be started in terms of when power could be turned on, when water source could be turned on, etc. I used to have to carry a cheat sheet just to remember how to correctly start it. Not so with this model. Turn on water, turn on power and away you go. The absolute best part is the quick connect for the hose. Just snap into place and you're in business. It does a great job, has the power I need, and is super easy to use. I highly recommend.",

Okay, a tiny 3\" puddle formed when I turned on the water, but none of this came from the hose connection, and no more came out during usage. 3) TOOL STORAGE fairly adequate but not perfect. Don't know what to do with the big GFCI plug, so I wrap it around the detergent bottle top. Hose reel too small diameter for the stiff hose, but works perfectly for a 40' heavy-duty extension cord. The hose hangs okay on the hose reel handle which locks into place in the upright position. 4) MY ONLY EXPERIENCE is with a commercial rental unit from several years ago, and my initial reaction to the 1900 PSI water flow was \"Oh, no!\" However my fears were relieved when I successfully pressure-washed my mother's entire aluminum siding (on a brick home), carport (some painted wood), porches, sidewalk, windows, and screens in one afternoon using no detergents. The house looked almost new. The turbo attachment worked best for me. Several stains on the concrete carport were resistant, but this home is 38 years old, and these stains have been sitting for a while (plus I was working fast and had no patience). Some strong detergents would probably help. Have used only once, but ran for 6 hours straight with no issues. 5) GREAT PURCHASE, and what a great tool (a small pressure washer) for around the home. Can't wait to start using it around mine. Will pay for itself in 1 or 2 uses, compared with paying somebody to do the work.",

            "review_text": "I bought this power washer after seeing my neighbor use his to power wash his stucco and sidewalk. The washer arrived quickly and in good condition. The assembly was straight forward if you read the instructions. Everything about this power washer looks to be high quality and well built. The main reason for buying a power washer was so cleaning my deck would be a little more effective than just scrubbing and using a garden hose. I will tackle that project soon, but just to test out the AR Blue pressure washer, I washed my cement sidewalk. I first mixed up some Dollar Store OxyClean and used a bucket and scrub brush to apply. I don't want to use the pressure washer to apply soap. After letting the cleaner do its thing for 10 minutes, I'm ready to use the pressure washer. WARNING: Before applying power to the washer, connect your garden hose, turn on the water all the way, then pull the trigger on the gun. You want to make sure all of the air is out of the system before turning it on. Once you see a nice flow of water coming out of the tip of the gun, THEN apply power to the unit and turn it on. This is something you have to do for all washers, gas and electric to prevent the motor and pump from getting destroyed. I used the adjustable wand and set it for the wide fan. When I pulled the trigger, this puppy roared to life. I keep the tip of the wand at least 6\" from the surface of the cement and watched with delight as years of dirt were removed from my white sidewalk. The reason I keep the wand 6\" away was because the water pressure at the tip is so great it will remove the top layer of cement. My neighbor let his son do his sidewalk and now instead of seeing a nice finishing layer of cement on top, you can see all of the large pebbles that were in the rough coat. I can't wait to do my deck now. I will use care when using the AR pressure washer on my wooden deck because of the amount of power at the tip. So far, I am loving the results that this pressure washer delivers. Update 8/18/2012 I decided to power wash my back patio a day after having great success washing my sidewalk. I had the surface all scrubbed with the OxyClean and I was ready to power wash the soap off. After turning on the water first, I pulled the trigger and the motor ran, but very little water came out. I tried turning the machine on and off several times. Turning off the water supply, thinking the water pressure was too much for the pump to over come. After 10 minutes of trying to get it to work like it did yesterday, I thought I would have to box it up and send it back to the factory. I then decided to take the garden hose off, then the clear filter adapter that screws into the machine. Inside the filter was grass, lots of grass. I took the clear filter apart and washed it in the sink. I also found lots of grass in the black adapter that screws on to the garden hose. After cleaning them out and putting everything back together, the machine was back to its magnificent self again. Word to the wise. Let your hose run for a minute before connecting to the power washer. I will also clean the filter after every use just in case. The patio looks like new!",

            "review_text": "The AR Blue Clean AR383 is an amazing little pressure washer. The AR383 takes about 5 minutes to assemble and you will only need a philips #2 screw driver. The quick change sprayer is very easy to use and requires no tools. When you use this for the first time do not be alarmed if you pull the trigger and nothing happens. This will happen if you don't turn it on (yes I forgot to turn it on). Ensure the water source to the unit is turned on as the washer pump will run until primed. The AR383 is very quiet. While wearing earphones I could not hear it running. So far I have washed two trucks, one motorcycle, a propane grill and a 40' RV. The pressure washer did not tip over once. This is a stable unit. It would be nice if the handle was adjustable as it is a little low for a person of 70\" in height. The low handle make the wheels pointless as I find it easier to just carry the washer. The hose storage reel is just that. You cannot use the washer unless the hose is completely unrolled from the reel because the end that attaches to the sprayer goes on the reel first. This is not really a big deal as the hose is only 20' long. The soap dispenser is a bottle that replaces the sprayer head. Pretty good design. It is a low pressure attachment. Don't waste your money on the manufacturer recommended \"special\" soap. Any liquid car wash soap is going to work. This unit has a maximum limit of 1,900 PSI. The normal operating PSI is 1,450. That being said I am sure that other manufactures use the upper end of their products limits as well. I have no complaints about the cleaning ability of this unit. At $170 this is a great item that is easy to use and small enough that it does not take up much room. I did purchase the brass male to male coupler. With this attached you can drag the water supply hose behind you with the unit and not worry about anything breaking. I would recommend that you use a light weight hose with the unit so that it is easier to move around with. If you are going to be using an extension cord with this unit ensure that it is one intended for heavy duty use. If you use one that is to small the GFCI built into the plug of the washer will continue to trip. Would I recommend this product? I think I just did.",

            "review_text": "I took a chance and purchased the AR Blue Clean AR383 from Amazon because the gas powered pressure washer that I borrowed from my cousin was broken and he couldn't fix it. For starters, it's fairly lightweight, feels sturdy, and looks decent. It's made out of your typical plastic like anything else nowadays. It comes with two different wand attachments and a soap sprayer bottle attachment. They appear to be fairly sturdy as well. Now for my gripes. The hose reel is pointless. You cannot have the wand hose hooked up to the washer while it's on the reel. The reel is only there for when you want to store the hose so if you plan on using it like I did (just simply reel the amount of hose you need) then pass on this design. If they just decided to make a small 1 foot hose lead from the washer to the reel it would have been perfect. You see this on garden hose storage boxes all the time. Simple $10 fix they neglected to add. The plastic nozzle they give you for the actual garden hose to attach to is for lack of a better term, a colander. It leaks like nothing I've ever seen before. I should have taken the advice of other reviews and gotten the adapter to simply screw the garden hose into. Would have been nice had they just put that on in the first place. The spot where you hook the wand hose up on the back is bad. You have to take the entirety of the power cord off to get to it. Where you wind up the power cord is just in the way of where the hookup is. Just bad location. I've yet to run to the local hardware store to pick an adapter up. As soon as I am able to properly test this pressure washer again, I'll give an updated and hopefully better review. For now, you could probably go with the AR240 and that would probably do the same light jobs without the need of a hose reel that you wont need.",

I needed a low-cost yet powerful and compact washer primarily to clean my lawn tractor. A garden hose nozzle was inadequate to get the crud off the underside of the mower deck, but after soaking it, this AR383 peels away the crud easily. The pressure spray is also strong enough to get most bugs off my truck windshield, extending time between trips to the car wash. I haven\u2019t lost any car paint to the pressure spray, but it did take paint off some lawn furniture. I\u2019ve used the unit to wash three wooden decks after applying deck cleaner solution, and it does a good job as long as you keep the spray moving. It can damage wood if the spray stays in one spot too long. The wide-angle nozzle is best for 90% of my work. Yes the connections drip sometimes and no I don\u2019t use the hose reel, but this is a great tool for the price. The AR383 worked well until a water supply hose ruptured and my slow reaction caused the pump to overheat. I called AR customer service looking for repair/replace information, but instead, AR sent me a new AR383 at no cost! The warranty was over; I inadvertently caused the failure; and, AR replaced the entire unit. Wow, I\u2019m impressed. Yes, I recommend the AR383 to others.",

The holder for the hose can only be used for storage and requires that you disconnect the hose from the unit. 3. Easy to change wands with different spray patterns. What I was not so happy with: 1. No way to adjust the pressure from the unit. You adjust the pressure with the type of tip and the distance from the object you are trying to clean! Pay attention to this as you can do a lot of damage in a hurry if you are not careful. 2. Plastic connector for connection to your water supply hose. This connection leaks, but what the heck, it is a small amount of water and you are getting things we anyway. 3. The height of the unit is such that it is easier to just pick it up to move it than to reach down and use the handle and wheels. Overall, the good far exceeds any perceived bad and I am very happy with the performance of the unit.

Only reason i put 4 stars is because this is my 2nd AR blue clean. I used the first one weekly for approx 1 year, and then it just completely stopped working. That being said, it works very well, and the accessories help you detail your car very well. I am very much into detailing and preventing swirls/scratches/webbing on my clear coat so this power washer helps me do that. I use the adjustable spray nozzle to blast almost all dirt and dust off car, then the soap sud shooter to get soap all over the car, and then i was from top to bottom. I love this, and I feel it is a must have for any avid home detailer. I noticed there didn't seem to be any other electric power washer on the market that had solid reviews so all in all it's a good find. ALso good for cleaning around the house. The water pressure in my neighborhood is horrible and this sucker still shoots water like you would expect and desire",

            "review_text": "As it only arrived recently I've only used this once so far, so I can't comment on the longevity of the washer, but I can comment on it's operation. The washer was simple to assemble the various cables and tool caddies, I was up and running in minutes. It came with everything pictured in the product picture: - Pressure hose - Gun / Wand - Variable Nozzle - Rotary Nozzle - Soap Dispenser - Inlet Water Filter - Quick-release garden hose adapter You will need to supply the following to get up and running: a garden hose, power, and a water supply. The Inlet Water Filter contains a fine mesh to stop large particles from within the hose or water supply from entering the washer and damaging / clogging the machinery. The soap dispenser attaches to the gun and the application of any detergents will be at low pressure. The manual states that this is more optimal than application of soap at high pressure, but I've yet to try either so can't comment further. The variable nozzle lets you adjust the spray from a single very-high pressure stream, to an almost 180 degree fan of water. The single stream is very powerful, so you'd best be careful where you point it, otherwise you'll find you'll likely be damaging whatever you're pointing it at. On the wider settings it still puts out a lot of pressure and I found it much more efficient to clean larger areas of my pool deck with. The pressure from the fan also generates a strong push of water and air which I found handy to use as a broom and sweep any light dirt around my deck and out the door. The rotary nozzle seems to emit a lower pressure stream than the variable one at it's finest setting, but the stream covers a wider area due to the internal rotation. I feel this nozzle will be best for general cleaning and concentrating a larger quantity of water in a single direction over a greater distance, rather than with the variable fan which will spread the water too far to the sides and not produce enough volume in a single direction. You'll probably use this to wash your car or rinse off your windows (from a safe distance). All in all I'm happy with this purchase and looking forward to spending a bit of time finally cleaning up my deck.",

A little research taught me that gas pressure washers are way more powerful than electric ones. Because of my heartbreaking experience with a finicky gas lawnmower that prompted me to buy an electric version, I decided to buy an electric pressure washer right out of the gate. Yes, the connector between my garden hose and this machine leaks! I bought a replacement brass version of the coupling at the Home Depot. Didn't fit; returned it. Oh well, what's a little leak? This is easy to use, very intuitive. I read the manual, but really, there was no need. I understood quickly how this thing worked. Is it powerful? Yes, since I hit my toes with a direct blast from the wand. Ouch! This cleaned my cement walkway with relative ease, and cleaned my house's algae covered stucco. One issue: this machine did not make a dent on some spilled paint on concrete. Sigh. I wish it was strong enough, but I have to get out my soy based paint remover and dab that on the paint spills... I had a blast using this machine, but I was soaking wet from the experience. I intend to stay drier as I learn to better use this machine. So, AR North America, please fix this leaking problem! Makes no sense that everybody loves the machine and hates the leak. Still, overall, a great buy.",

            "review_text": "Bought this unit about a year ago for our summer place in the mountains. I have a 6.5hp Craftsman gas washer, but it's a hassle to transport. Fast forward a year, and the pump on the Craftsman has given up the ghost. I brought home the Blue to do a few jobs over the weekend. This thing kicked butt over the past 4 days. I have done no less than 25 hours of washing over the past 4 days, including a 40'x12 redwood arbor, 3 smaller arbors, a 50x12 redwood deck, 20 teak patio chairs, 8 ottomans, pads for all, and the entire outside of the house. The big arbor was probably the worst job. A couple years after having it built, we decided to have it stained. Big mistake. For whatever reason, the stain turned black (I mean BLACK) and looked terrible. My wife called a few painters to get bids to paint it white, and they came in between $1600 and $3300. Just for fun, on the day before the painters were supposed to start, I hit one of the worst spots on the arbor with the washer-the results blew us both away. I power washed the entire thing, a 1-1/2\" swath at a time. Took me 2 solid days, but it looks like new AND I saved some cash. I've even pulled the thing up onto the roof to clean skylights-something that would be impossible with the Craftsman. Yeah...I really like this machine. (and yes-it did do the annoying leak thing out of the box, but a little Ace Hardware MacGuyvering fixed it up fine). If it breaks tomorrow, I'll order another one. [UPDATE} Literally the day after I wrote the review above, the pressure hose blew out on my washer. When the pump is on, the hose stays pretty straight, but when you turn it off, it kinks up. The blowout occurred on a kink. Sucks, but with a hose that small, there's not much that can be done. Went to ACE to try and find parts to adapt the hose on my old Craftsman to the Blue, and lo and behold, there was a complete replacement kit from Blue sitting on the shelf! $40 for a new hose, trigger assembly, 2 lances, and chemical injector. Sweet deal, and I was back in business in less than a half hour. Nice to know the local stocks the washers and parts.",

Then the gun receptor for the hose broke and that was a bit more expensive, to replace the gun itself (again on Amazon). And now, in the early spring of it's third year, on it's first use, the entire machine starting sputtering after 10 minutes, and, then, as other reviewers have described, it started smoking and stinking of burnt plastic. The engine shifted down and the pressure was cut by 2/3 and the smoke continued. I finally turned it off for fear of a fire. A day later, no improvement, more smoke and weak pressure. We are tossing the unit out, very much feeling we didn't get our money's worth. I will not be buying another one from this company.",

I did not have any leaks and pressure appears to be as advertised in the 1,900 PSI range. This is 4 stars @ $115, 3 stars at $158 and 2 stars at $199. Price is the key on this item.

I used the turbo spray, it took me 6 hours to do the pool deck and the cement plant pots which now look wonderful. The hose and power cord reach quite far, I was pushing it to get to the other side of my pool but I managed without an extension cord. The 2nd day I did my front walk and driveway. They both look SO much better. There are old stains from the neglect that I'm guessing will never come out but the black is gone. It was very easy to assemble, if the cheap plastic parts don't last I don't mind, it's the power cord, hose and wand I need. When you first turn it on there was a quick 'start up noise' which shut off just as fast. Don't be alarmed, I guess it's just charging up because it blasted away as soon as I began to work.

That may be the reason it doesn't work well for me. After about 2 years of ownership it started to be unable to continuously spray at pressure. After about second of pressurized spraying the stream slowed to a trickle and there was audible evidence that the pump was spinning at a higher than normal rpm. If I release the trigger it will continue to pump at this increased rpm unless i shake the unit. If i shake the unit it pressures up and is ready for another 1 second of usage. This makes the unit useless. Maybe it would work fine with city water pressure. Maybe my unit is defective, I don't know. Its kind of a tangled mess to work with but I guess that comes with the territory of electric pressure washers. I don't like the way the garden hose attachment point protrudes out of the front of it. I feel its only a matter of time until that breaks. It has got more difficult to use the twist-lock system to attache different nozzles over time to the point now that its a pain.

I never use the reel for the hose and the area for the power cord was not aesthetically designed and you have to do more work to unwrap the cord since you can't just take the whole spool off at once. At first I didn't like the different kind of nozzle, partially because it didn't work with any of my nozzles I had and you have to buy a new wand attachment just for the blaster. I learned to really like the adjustable width nozzle that comes with it though. It's really nice to be able to change it right there without having to even stop the water flow.

            "review_text": "After reading a few reviews about people having issues getting it put together I have determined those people were trying to use the instructions in a foreign language. It was very easy to put together and very few pieces at that. I spent about 5 hours washing the concrete in my back yard when I got it and it went off without a hitch. Holding the nozzle about a foot away from the ground, it cleaned the surface wonderfully. I had to get closer to the ground to get the green mildew/algae (after winter time rain) off and it did come off too. I also felt the cost was very reasonable for the product. I went to Home Depot to look at their equipment and they had lower PSI washers for the same and higher prices. Pros: It is pretty powerful. I like that if you let go of the handle and then squeeze it real fast, you get a less powerful stream out of it. Its not a big unit so its easy to transport and lift. I have back issues and i found no issue lifting it. The machine is also fairly quiet. I was expecting something much louder. After 5 hours of use, I didn't have a headache and my ears didn't ring. My gas leaf blower is much louder than this washer. Cons: I wish the wand was longer. I'm not sure if that has to do with the pressure and what not, but because of my back issues, I was hunched over a lot because the wand was pretty short. I'd like to see an extension part for it so it can be used short (if you are cleaning the side of your house or something), but can be make longer for the ground or high up places. I would definitely recommend this product to my family/friends.",

            "review_text": "So I decided on this model for the price to psi ratio. It is primarily used with a foam canon for the cars, and to clean off the front porch. I noticed, as with most electric washers, that they can not compare against gas washers in psi and overall stream strength. But for light duty cleaning, it works great since it is quiet, only runs when you press the trigger, and is light and easy to move around. As some others have said, the hose that comes with this model is not the best. I will be buying a better, more maneuverable hose some time soon. But I am happy with this product after a month for what I need it for. So, if you need a pressure washer that is light, easy to use, and priced right, get this one. If you need high levels of pressure for tough oil stains and such, you may want to consider a gas operated one.",

Honestly, my garden hose with a tapered \"pressure\" nozzle has a more powerful stream and will reach out much, much further than this device will. The reel that is used to store the pressure hose, which is simply plastic tubing, puts a crease in the hose when you insert the hose into the reel's retainer clips. So I have stopped using the storage reel in order to stop damaging the hose. It comes with a pretty long electric cord. However, the three cord retaining clips are not wide enough and deep enough to completely wrap the entire cord. The clips run out of space when there is still about 6 feet of cord that needs to be wound up. The unit comes with two 'push-in\" nozzles that fit into the washer handle. One of these has some sort of spinning jet nozzle inside of it, and this is the one that can do some major cleaning. But it must be only inches away from the surface, or else it does nothing much. The nozzle retainer caddy on the washer has two clips, one for each nozzle. These are not sized correctly, so the nozzles barely fit into them and will fall out when you try to wheel the washer around the garage driveway or yard. This product is made in China.",

The main purpose I got the washer was to rehab a deck. My deck is approx. 5 years old and gets very little sun each day. The grime and green mildew was crazy. So, I bought the AR 383 and put it to the test. ****Beware**** the first boards I cleaned literally drove a 1/8\" mark into the boards. However, when I figured out how to use the AR 383 and took some time, the dirt just disappeared from my deck. This is a very strong washer that can take on most if not all home tasks.

This little guy cleaned 13 years of crud, grime and mildew off our 1,600 sq ft cement patio effortlessly. Then went on to power wash the brick & siding on the house & did a fantastic job on these materials as well. No leaks, quiet operation & POWERFUL. FIVE stars all the way on this AR383 from me. Update 6/15/13 I did end up purchasing the turbo patio cleaner accessory from AR Blue for $19.95 Along with an extra extension wand. Being 6'2\" the extra extension wand allowed me to stand straight up with no bending over. I would suggest to anyone who's tall to spend a few extra dollars for an additional extension wand. BTW the $19.95 Turbo Patio Cleaner did an amazing job of removing even more crud off the cement. The patio cleaner unit has stiff bristles brushes the surround the underside of the unit and scrub the surface and work in conjunction with the powerful rotating spray arms on the unit.

Those washers were all heavy, and too powerful for the types of applications I needed to clean.

We have several large paver patios and it did a great job cleaning the surface and removing the moss and dirt that had accumulated in the spaces between them. I tested it on the siding of my house, cedar which seems to breed mildew, knowing that I needed to clean it before staining and the result of that test was great. The ARBC has just the right amount of pressure and got rid of the mildew without damaging the siding. I will use it to clean all of the siding before I start to re-stain the cedar. The only negatives if you want to call them that is the hose storage reel is a bit challenging to use and I found that storing the hose off the reel works better for me. I would have appreciated a bit longer electrical cord. The length of the electrical cord while adequate for most of my applications was a bit short for my large lot. Overall, I would strongly recommend it.",

This thing has plenty of power for most jobs - granted, for concrete/bricks you have to have a lot of time on your hands given it only has 1900 psi and you have to make very small swipes to get it clean. But I love how quiet it is vs a gas powered unit I'd have to maintain year to year and wear ear protection when using. I have not yet replaced the water hose adapter, but I had no problems with it leaking at all - used a little plumbers teflon tape on all threads and it seals with no leakage. Yeah, the hose reel isn't really usable - I recommend removing it and instead velcro-ing in your pressure hose in the slot. Pros: Fast Setup/Breakdown Powerful enough for most jobs (it can still remove old paint so be careful on your painted surfaces) Quiet (compared to gas powered equivalents) Relatively Inexpensive Cons: Plastic water hose connector won't last Really cleaning concrete/bricks/stone takes a lot of patience",

I am not disappointed. It works great. The AR383 arrived yesterday. I used it on a Trex deck on the side of our house today. We've had the deck for three and a half years and only washed it with a hose from time to time. It is subject to dust blowing from nearby farm fields, from residue dropping from airplanes landing at two local airports, and a lot of wind carried debris. I knew if I ever tried to tackle cleaning the Trex with a scrub brush it would not produce good results. From the first few inches of cleaning I knew I had made a good purchase. A dark layer of dirt came off exposing a long lost clean color of the deck. The deck has 6 stairs on each end, is about 6' wide and about 30' long. It took me about two hours to do the whole thing. I also used the pressure washer to wash the dirt off the white painted wooden fence along the side of the deck which came out really nice. AR North America must have gotten the message about the leaking hose fitting. They didn't ship the fitting in the manual. I had already purchased the brass fitting replacement but didn't need to use it. The new hose fitting is a two part quick release connection that didn't leak a drop. I found I could wrap the hose around the hose reel as designed. I read where several people thought it wouldn't work but it worked fine for me. The power cord wraps around the back side but it was just a bit too much cord for the way the AR383 is designed and the last few turns were outside the holding bracket. This isn't a tool that I would grab and use for a small job without knowing that the time to set it up and put it away is at least 5 to 10 minutes on each end of the job. But my imagination was running wild with all the jobs I could do with it. The machine doesn't make too much noise, and the cord and high pressure hose are long enough for all applications around my house. I appreciate that the pump shuts off quickly after releasing the handle. I do wish the handle had a lock to keep it on so I wouldn't have to hold it on all the time. My hand is tired after cleaning the deck. I have nothing to compare this with but I like it a lot and highly recommend it. Time will tell about reliability.",

I see a lot of good review, so I guess I it's most likely a good product -- but the machine I got was a dud. UPDATE: Called the manufacturer today, and they walked me through trouble shooting. Nothing worked. BUT, after a few steps, the manufacturer was quick of offer a replacement -- with NO hassles. Thank you.",

You have to just expect that with these plastic models. Bought this one to clean the deck and teak patio furniture. It worked great right out of the box. Absolutely no leaks anywhere. Easy to assemble. I called AR customer service to ask a question during the assembly, and they answered on the first ring and could not have been nicer. FYI, when you first turn on the power button, the machine will make noise only for a second while it pressurizes. Then it goes silent, until you pull the trigger on the gun. It ONLY runs when you pull the trigger, which is nice. (at first, I thought it was broken because there was no noise) I had to turn down the pressure (very easy to adjust it by turning the nozzle of the gun) to not damage the wood furniture. Once I found the right pressure, it was great. Did not use any detergent - just water. Nobody can believe the difference in the furniture. Totally worth the price for what I plan to use it for.",

It has a quick connect plastic piece that screws on the hose end and then plugs into the washer. The only problem is the plastic piece will not screw onto any of the hoses I have tried. It won't tighten enough to not have leaks. I also fear the this plastic will crack after several uses and then I won't be able to attach a hose at all. The washer has storage places on the back for the extra pole and wash bottle. This is convenient but the poles don't stay secure and often fall out.

I felt it was time for me to buy a pressure washer which I could use on other things as well. Friends have always told me that when buying outdoor powered tools those powered by gasoline engines are always more efficient and powerful. However, I have had bad luck over the years with anything that requires me to pull a rope to start it up so I had to consider an electric pressure washer in spite of my awareness that gas is better. I spent a lot of time reading reviews on the internet and the AR Blue Clean model AR383 was highly regarded in every review I read. So 4 days after ordering the unit from Amazon I was using it to remove the mildew on my siding. It was easy to use and did a superb job. Next was the resin outdoor furniture I was going to trash after 10 years of use; it almost looked like new when I finished washing it with this unit. The AR383 is well made, compact and was a pleasure to use. I would highly recommend it to anyone",

I also advise lubing the rubber seals with an appropriate lube as to not damage and makes an easy connection at the fittings. The only cons are that the pressure hose is too stiff and that it's so stiff don't even try to put it on the reel as shown the product photo. You'll see what I mean. I suggest wrapping it at the handle. Lastly the plastic quick connect to the garden hose is cheap and easily cracks. I have a heavy duty garden hose and the sheer weight of it when pulling the machine around caused it to crack. I accidentally and lightly brushed my rubber shoe against the new one and it cracked again. I advise a light weight garden hose and be very cautious of that fitting",

While this only has 100 psi more then my Karcher did, it seemed to be a bit more powerful. It actually removed some stuff that the Karcher missed. I've had this about a month, but this weekend was its first major workout. I bought this with the Deck, Patio & Flat Surface Cleaner, which was a big time save. I have about 2000 sq feet of concrete and textured concrete, in south Florida. It requires power washing every 3-4 months. the Deck, Patio & Flat Surface Cleaner was a big time saver. I did not experience many of the issue that other have covered in their reviews, but then I have different issues of my own. Mine does not leak where the hose connects, though I did buy the female to female connector that every one mentioned. Also, I have found that the plastic tube/hose that goes to the gun rolls quite nicely onto the integrated reel. My complaints are the location of the connector for the plastic tube/hose that goes to the gun. Whomever thought that was a good place to put the metal connector on the body of the power washer needs to actually use it. Because it is buried amongst the plastic that hold the cord and accessories, it is very difficult to undo. The second is a complaint is one I have about most all power washers. Include a trigger lock. When you are power washing for 6-8 hours, depressing a trigger ends up being a very sore experience. You will hurt while you are doing it and for hours after you are done. Please, please, please, give me a trigger lock.",

I bought several extensions direct from the manufacturer($6 each, much less than here) to try the gutters. There are lots of attachments available... bought a floor cleaner as well, but haven't used it yet. But the gutters - with all those attachments (~5 of them for my raised ranch), when you pull the trigger, it flexes and blasts the wand backward, out of the gutter. You simply cannot control it. This was the reason I purchased the unit. Unless your gutters are almost within reach, you probably cannot clean them with this. However, on all the other tasks I've listed above, it performed very well. This may be the best electric pressure washer there is, but you still might want to go with gas. I've been thinking of giving this one to my dad and going with a gas unit. Yes, more maintenance, noisy, smelly, but saving $100-$200 a year on gutter cleaning might make me do it. I just don't do ladders. On a side note, I backed my truck into the unit and cracked the connection between the unit and the hose (the blue piece that clips on the plastic piece that threads onto the unit - the quick connect coupling). I called AR and they shipped me a new one, plus the additional clear piece I didn't even need, free of charge. And as I said before, buying accessories direct from them is quite affordable, possibly beating everyone else, depending on the piece. I can't do 5 stars due to the lack of gutter cleaning, but it is a 4 for the product, 4.5 with the great customer service and good manufacturer standing behind the unit.",

The house has vinyl siding, concrete walks and is heavily shaded, meaning that everything gets a greenish-black layer of moss/mildew from lack of sun. I also own a boat, a fifth wheel camper and a couple of cars which are always in need of spruce up, so there's no lack of work for a good pressure washer. Previously, I owned a Honda-powered Karcher washer that did a great job, but was bulky, heavy, noisy and a hassle in general. I decided that I wanted an electric and the AR383 seemed to fit the bill with fairly high pressure and being self-contained. The unboxing experience was outstanding. The actual product package was outer-boxed in a plain cardboard container, which doesn't need to be removed in order to open the inner package. Next, the packaging and product components were \"stacked\" inside the box. This is nice because the parts can be removed individually and set aside without worrying everything falling apart as you pull stuff out of the box. Bubble wrap was at a minimum and there is almost no tape (often, everything is taped together and then slipped into the box, which makes for a frustrating assembly process). Assembly is easy and simply enough to be shown (with actual photos and very good drawings) on just a couple of pages. The descriptions are decent with good English (the manual is multi-language, but I can't comment on any of the others). The plastic is of decent quality and only a phillips screwdriver is needed (there's a total of five screws that attach the tool holders). It was getting late, but I wanted to try the beast out, anyway. Being an electric, I assumed the unit would be fairly quiet and I wasn't disappointed. The unit only runs when the trigger is pulled, excluding a brief period when you first flip the switch to pressurize the wand line (A word to the wise, turn your water on before you turn the pump on and squeeze the trigger to purge any air in your hoses or pump. This ensures that the pump does not run \"dry\" as most of the pumps use the water for cooling and lubrication during operation). I cleaned a section of my deck, a concrete slab of about 100 square feet (10x10), a section of siding and a short length of mildew-infested gutter. The jet nozzle has a very tight pattern and works well in expansion joints and really tough dirt (probably good for paint removal, etc, also). The rotary nozzle is a spinning flat jet that works wonders on normal dirt and my ever-present mildew and moss. For most of what I worked on, holding the spray tip about six to eight inches from the surface produced a three or four inch wide pattern that is strong enough to clear everything down to the underlying surface. I did not work with the detergent bottle at all. All in all, I'm happy with the performance. Longevity is yet to be seen, but based on the visible quality, I'm confident that this machine will provide good non-commercial service.",

You have to let go of the trigger wait for 10 secs and turn on again. Similarly, sometimes you wouldnt get much pressure. You just have to stop everything, wait a min, and then try again and everything works. Not sure why, but seems to be design issue.

I read the reviews of owners of the AR Blue Clean AR383 1,900 PSI unit offered by Amazon.com, and decided to purchase it. First, the leakage problem refered to by one owner, is no longer a problem, as the manufacturer has changed the design and now includes a quick connect coupler,(garden hose to the unit) which includes a see through conector that contains a water filter. (neat idea) Other nice features: the high pressure hose has a quick disconnect from the Gun (handle), which makes dealing with the stiff high pressure hose easier to coil and store. The adjustable spray nozzle is a must when considering a pressure washer purchase, as some units offer 3 or 4 different nozzle tips, that you must stop to change, when you encounter different cleaning procedures. With this adjustable nozzle you can go from a pencil point spray, (which by the way is great for knocking down wasps nests) to a fan spray, by simply rotating the end nozzle. The biggest surprise, however, is the \"Turbo nozzle\" This nozzle seems to add so much cleaning power to the unit. What is easily noticeable is the area it covers while cleaning. With a fan spray you can only clean, by moving the fan forward and back, which cleans the width of the fan spray. The turbo nozzle, works more like a flashlight beam. It cleans a circular area, and therefore you can go back and forth, side to side, or even in a circular motion. The unit includes a nice accessory holder to store all the components. It has a built in hose reel for the high pressure hose, but because the hose has a ridged connector at each end, it is difficult to wind it on to the built in reel. I just coil it and loop it around the handle. I received this unit in 3 business days, with no shipping cost. This unit is a great bargain!",

            "review_text": "I got my AR383, unboxed it, and immediately put it to the test cleaning my much neglected paver patio driveway that was being over run with weeds. I tried cleaning with the adjustable nozzle at first, and, while it did a good job cleaning the pavers, it struggled with removing the weeds. Not impressed, I decided to switch to the turbo nozzle. The turbo nozzle tore through those weeds like a hot knife through butter! And, it did a good job with cleaning the pavers. Lesson learned -- use the proper nozzle for the job. Some other thoughts -- the power was adequate for home use -- not overpowered or underpowered. Between the length of the electric cord and hose, the range was more than adequate. I read a lot of bad feedback on the plastic quick release. Personally, I loved that feature. Very easy to connect and not a drop of leakage. Either AR Blue fixed the problem, or I just haven't had the unit long enough to experience any problems. I can see the potential to damage the quick release, since it's made of plastic, if you're not careful when moving the unit with the hose connected. If the hose comes in at an angle, it could put pressure on the quick release and cause problems. The only minor criticism that I have of the product is the design of the hose reel. My previous pressure washer's hose was connected directly through the reel, so when you weren't using it, you simply wind the reel and you're done. With the AR Blue, the hose doesn't connect directly to the reel. When you store it, you disconnect the hose from the machine, connect the front of the hose (the end that connects to the gun) to the reel and wind it up. Not a major headache, but from a design point of view, it isn't as seamless. Since I've only used this product once, I can't comment on its durability. So far, though, I am happy with the purchase and would recommend. ** Just an update after using this item 3 times over the past 3 months. Everything still holds true in my original post. I washed my pavers again today, and, again, it did a great job. One thing that I found that I really don't like about the design of the product is where the hose connects to the back of the machine. The connection is a little too close to the area where you wrap the cord. It's hard to get a firm grip to twist the hose on. And, for some reason, I couldn't thread the hose connector on for the life of me. I ultimately sprayed some WD-40 on the connector and it helped a lot. I've always been very careful not to mis-thread the connector, so that wasn't the problem. By no means is this a deal breaker. It's still an excellent product. It just needs some slight design tweaking to give it 5 stars.",

            "review_text": "This pressure washer exceeded my expectations. As a previous owner of a gas-powered 2700 PSI unit I expected performance just a bit above a hose with a pressure nozzle. My primary need was to clean sidewalks in my retirement community. On-line reviews lead me to believe this was a good unit but it has performed much better than anticipated. The attachments all proved useful and the included wands provided a good range of cleaning patterns and pressure for everything from cleaning grimy plastic light fixtures (back off if you don't want them to appear sand-blasted) to screens -- and those sidewalks. I have read advice to replace the plastic hose coupler with a brass unit and I'm sure that might be better for heavier or more frequent use. But over two different periods of use, exceeding 3-4 hours each, I have not had any issues with leaks. The wind-up hose storage and place to wrap the cord make for a compact storage footprint. Comment from neighbors wife (hubby had used a lower-powered electric) \"what did you put on your sidewalk - it came out a lot whiter?\" I had just used water. Hopefully I will be this happy with the unit a year from now but considering local HD wants about $100 to rent a unit for a few hours and a contractor wanted $150 to do what I have done in about 4-5 hours it will pay for itself if it lasts a year -- and then some --- sweet!",

            "review_text": "I've tried several different electric washers (Karcher, Lowes and Harbor Freight) and they were all junk and ceased working within a very short period of time. I bought this unit about six months ago, have used it extensively and so far, no issues. A couple of minor problem mentioned by others: Lack of a quick disconnect - they simply are not available in this size (15mm) for the pressure side of the unit. The supply side takes a standard quick connect garden hose fitting. The pressure hose reel - worthless. I would have much rather they turned it into a cord reel which might actually serve a purpose. Far easier to just wrap everything around the machine. Pressure. Every washer I've used is overrated as to PSI and this one is no exception. I think they measure these with the wand set on pinpoint, which you would never use. Once you open it up to a fan pattern, it probably has dropped off to about 1000psi (or less). However, it did get somewhat more powerful as it got broken in. It's satisfactory for light washing, any heavy duty and you will want a gas washer anyway. Detergent system. Frankly, it's a pain to have to fill and install a separate bottle for the cleaner. Other systems manage to use either a siphon or have an onboard tank that is connected to the wand so that you just change the wand setting to dispense detergent. If the manufacturer can correct these relatively minor annoyances, it will become a five star product. UPDATE: 07/15/2013. Well, the unloader valve finally gave up the ghost on this machine, much like it has on every inexpensive electric pressure washer I've ever owned. It starts but pulsing on and off when you've released the trigger and eventually progresses to the point where it won't shut off at all. Still, two years of fairly heavy use is about all that can really be expected unless you spend a lot more than this or stick with a gas powered pressure washer from someone like Honda (my Honda 3000 psi is now thirteen years old and still works flawlessly but it was over $1500). I suspect if you only use this a few times a year, store it properly (drained and not in freezing temps), it will last a long time. I used mine almost weekly to powerwash cars, driveways, siding etc.. Still left it at 4 stars because it's about the best electric in this price range.",

I did not want the hassle of maintaining a gas washer so I went electric again. I was going through my book with all my old manuals and found the Karcher receipt- ~15 \u00bd years ago I paid $179+ and this unit I paid $149 and got 200PSI more. I have had no issues others have mentioned. I was going to buy the brass coupler based on others reviews about leaking but decided to wait and see. The product was delivered in about 3 days and the shipping was free. I used it to wash my siding and pavers. I used this for three consecutive days about 6hrs each day with maybe a 15 min break each day. No motor overheating or burning up and no leaks. Wand hose attachment instead of at the butt end is forward of the trigger which helps with the balance and lessened wrist and arm fatigue. Wand is much lighter than my old Karcher 330M unit which died a couple of hrs into my work. I would have power washed more around the house but it's getting too cold here. I agree about the hose reel, too tight just drape it over the handle in a loose coil. It's like those garden hose reels people buy and then wonder why they bought them, it never works right and not worth the time and effort to coil it up. No idea why the wheels, way too low to wheel by the handle unless it's a child pulling it along. Make the handle extendable and now you're talking. Light enough to pick it up walk. Over all a good product which performed great. I would recommend to a fried to buy. I hope it lasts as long as my old one.",

The one thing I will say is that the 'special' turbo wand that is supposed to be good at stripping didn't work nearly as well as the regular blade-shape sprayer. It did have a problem with my deck - I guess the combination of a horizontal surface with years of neglect are too much for 1900 psi. I'll have to rent a gas unit for that I think. I guess there's a limitation to what these electric washers can do, but I'd buy a 3000 psi from AR Blue in a flash if they had one.",

The product is light weight, easy for a small woman to handle, it is on wheels and the attachments fit nicely on the unit itself. It comes with two different spray handles each with adjustable ends which I would think could handle any type of spraying that is needed. Also has spray bottle attachment.It stands upright so it fits nicely against the wall. The pressure is excellent and what is really nice is that by releasing the trigger the water pressure will automatically decrease to a softer spray. In our old machine we had to adjust the spray heads each time. The increase and decrease is easily done by engaging the trigger. We cleaned a two story deck and gazebo and the machine handled very well. Easy to set up, easy to put away. As homeowners we feel this machine can certainly handle our deck, concrete, fencing and all jobs in cleaning that are necessary to use a pressure washer. We like the machine, the electrical cord is long, the hose is also long and sufficient to the jobs as needed. Cons: As stated by others we will not take the time to roll up the hose unless storing for sometime. It's kind of awkward to roll and the space to roll into is tight. The hose is a stiff rubber I would not call it plastic as someone stated an it does tangle but has not been a concern since we straighten it out before we started.The more we used the unit the more flexible the hose became and less stiff. We can see the more we use it the stiffness is disappearing. The plastic adapter at first I just snapped it in the blue piece an attached it and it did leak slightly. However I noticed on the blue plastic that there were arrows so I pulled back the blue piece, then attached the cone shape and snapped it in and the unit has not leaked. Bottom line even if we were to have any issues with this plastic adapter we would have no problem replacing it because everything else handles so well. We would recommend it. It's a nice machine for the price.",

            "review_text": "We purchased this particular pressure washer based on internet reviews and, in particular, good comments about AR North America's (ARNA) customer service. The comments concerning leakage at the inlet hose connector were bothering, but later reviewers indicated that that problem had been mitigated. The unit we received came with an instruction manual referencing both the old-style \"barrel\" connector and the now-shipping quick-disconnect adapter. Upon assembly with the QD connector, we did get a fair amount of leakage. An email to ARNA's customer support was answered quickly with both instructions (essentially make sure it is tightened properly) and an offer to send a replacement if the leakage continued. As others have noted, the inlet port on the unit is slightly recessed, making it a bit difficult to tighten things. In addition, the QD connector is plastic, so there is the fear of breaking it with excessive tightening. A metal QD adapter would be a nice upgrade for ARNA to consider. Our solution was to purchase a package of rubber hose replacement washers (plastic may work also) and put one in each piece of the QD connector (these in addition to the washers already there). The end result is that there are now essentially no leaks. The additional washers make it easier to tighten both the connector to the unit and the hose to the connector. In the relatively brief time we have had the unit (a few weeks now), it has performed very well. The motor shut-off when the wand trigger is released is nice, though one should be sure to purge the water supply hose of air since that may cause the unit to cycle (and, air in the line is probably not good for the pump). Cleaning performance is good for the size unit and is certainly well within our expectations. Storage for the pressure hose and power cord is not the unit's strong point (also as noted by others). The solution we implemented involves a ratcheted plastic \"cord clamp\" which is large enough in diameter to go around both the coiled pressure hose and power cord and secure them to the unit's handle. This also makes them very easy to deploy when using the unit. These clamps are generally available at big-box home stores. Overall, we are quite pleased with the unit so far.",

AMAZON RETURN PROCEDURE IS AMAZINGLY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD. THEY HAVE A REPLACEMENT ON THE WAY ALREADY. FREE SHIPPING ON THE RETURN, AND ALSO THE REPLACEMENT. COULDN'T BE BETTER. Easy set up. Good quick start guide. All that is needed is 15 minutes and a #2 Phillips. A tip...when first setting it up, spread a small film of petroleum jelly on all the \"O\" rings. Makes it much easier to connect/disconnect lances, detergent bottle and HP hose to gun. And helps keep \"O\" rings from leaking and in good shape. After buying and returning a Campbell Hausfield 1835 (died after 2 hours), I purchased this AR 383. It is smaller, quieter, more powerful, $20 more expensive. But most importantly this one stays working. Leak free...No leaks what-so-ever. The plastic quick connect works great. The two wands work well and are easy to attach to the gun. All attachments mount on board. The roller will work for electrical cord or the high pressure hose. Although it is easier just to coil them up and place over the handle on the machine. I actually like the separate detergent bottle attachment. You can fill it with any kind of solution and not worry about clogging the pump. And make the solution as strong as you want...with no worries. The machines dilution rate is 10:1. So it sprays 10 parts water to one part bottle solution. So you want to dilute the bottle detergent to avoid using too much detergent. Great for car, motorcycle, dirt bike washes, Siding, driveway, concrete, paint removal, lawnmower decks, charcoal grills. Yesterday I washed our 38 foot RV in about an hour. Without this machine it takes a lot longer. Machine is just the right amount of power. Not too much as to cause damage...like a gas job...but strong enough to do what you need it for. Not many things I would recommend as highly.",

I orginally bought an Earthwise PWO2200 2,000 psi 1.6 gpm Electric Pressure Washer and it was a miserable experience. It worked but was wonky and then eventually just blew itself apart (somewhat literally, but mostly figuratively). I decided to give this Blue Clean washer a try instead and am very happy with it. The pressure isn't as high as the Earthwise was, but it's close and this one has been working reliably for me for quite a while now (I've had it for about a year now). This one is lighter and a little smaller than the Earthwise so it's easier for me to move around. Cleaning my entire driveway, walkway and patio area takes an afternoon. I wish it cleaned faster than that, but for the price and ease of maintenance I just can't complain. My one real complaint is with the cord and wand storage. The holder that's included just doesn't do the job of holding everything very well. It's not a huge problem, but it does suck to have things falling out of their holders when I move it and they get jostled around. Still, I think it's a great value for the price and convenience. Update May 2014: Several years on we're still using this washer and it's still working as well as it did at the start. We routinely wash our patio and sidewalks with it and once or twice a year we clean the driveway and wooden outdoor furniture. It's been great for getting winter gunk off the hammock in the spring, and we've even used the jet setting to shoot down some hornets nests way up high. Excellent value!",

I've done a lot of research on it and yes it is connected correctly. The connection just doesn't have a strong seal. Another complaint is that the pressure washer hose attach to the gun does not wind up in the cradle like it shows in the photo. The tubing is so thick/hard that it does not bend and the plastic winder is so cheap that it cannot force the tubing to wrap around it. This pressure washer also does not have a lock on the handle. If you're pressure washing a long sidewalk or a large deck, your hand begins to cramp holding the handle down for long periods of time. It would be more convenient to have a locking mechanism in place so you didn't have to clamp the handle down for long jobs.",

The hoses and nozzles are easy to put together and interchange. The Soap canister that it has is just for spaying the solution onto whatever you are going to clean, it comes out like spray foam. It does not come out with any significant force. The only downside to this use is the amount that the adapter for the hose sticks out from the unit. I have NOT had any part of this unit break or leak, but I feel that this is the most vulnerable part of the unit as you are pulling on the hose and the machine is stationary. It is easy to tip over and bump or bang the adapter. So far I am not having any trouble with mine.",

Many people advised me that I would not like it because it wouldn't have enough power to clean my decks and outdoor furniture. They were wrong! I LOVE this little machine, and it's so easy to use that I am cleaning everything around the house and yard. It starts with a flip of a switch, it has plenty of power, and it's no noisier than my vacuum cleaner....all in all, it's a great purchase! The only glitch that I had with the power washer was a leak where the garden hose hooks to the machine. The plastic part that was in the box was cheap and unusable. I happened to have a short F/F hose (I think from an old washing machine), so I use that instead and now I have no more leaks! The instructions say not to use an extension cord with it, because it will cause the motor to overheat and burn out. This limitation would limit its usefulness, so I did a little online research and found that I can use a heavy duty (12-3) extension cord, as long as it's not over 50' in length. I ordered one from Amazon and used it today. It worked fine!",

Then I went nuts with it: cleaned my outside sheds, my back deck, and our plastic kiddie pool. Then I used the fan sprayer to wash our cars. What a difference! Didn't use any soap - just the water, then a towel and a chamois. What used to take about 50 minutes got reduced to 25 minutes, including the time it takes to get the unit, assemble it, disassemble it, and put it away. My neighbor was so impressed, he went out and bought one too. I'd actually like to give this 4 1/2 stars. The only quibbles I have are that the wands don't snap in to the holder securely and the hose is a little challenging to get on and off the reel. Overall, I'm sorry I waited so long to get one.",

I did not want to get involved with a gasoline unit but I wanted the best power in an electric model. The only problem that I had with assembly was threading the hose reel. The instructions on this point were not helpful, so I did what other reviewers have done and just wraped the hose to the wand around the top of the unit. Don't worry about the plastic water hose connector; it works fine. There are two wands that you can use. One with a narrow pencil point spray for maximum power and one with a stripe spray for best coverage. I found the latter the most useful because the pencil point spray covers such a small area that it would take forever to clean a large area. Some other brands come with changeable nozzles which would be nice. Nevertheless, the wide wand removed about 90% of the mold on the patio which had not been cleaned for 5 years. The difference was amazing! I then used it on my aluminum siding which had dirt and algae on it. Again, it worked great on the first floor sections. The second floor sections did not have much algae so I was satisfied with what it did, but others may want a more powerful sprayer for two stories. I then washed my car without having to bend over. It worked as well as any car wash in that it took off the dirt and bird spots but left tar. Again, I was satisfied. The unit had already paid for itself.",

A built in bottle with an adjustable wand (between soap and turbo) would have been great. The unit also needs a higher handle for us tall people but this is not that big of a deal. The hose is rather unflexible when trying to put back on the reel. The machine did a nice job of cleaning dirt and moss up from sidewalks and driveways but oil and rust stains are still visible. After looking at all the reviews for hours on other machines, this was the best machine for the money.

The AR383 was a good compromise and she is, \"Thrilled with it.\" after using it for cleaning rubber mats, wood walls, and concrete floors in her stable. I assembled and set it up, ready to run in about 20 minutes. The plastic wands seem a bit light duty to me, but they worked well and installed in the pressure handle with minimal leakage. Like other users, I don't think much of the plastic, quick-lock fitting for the water hose connection, but it does contain a filter which would help prevent clogs in the nozzle. After working with the connection for a while, we were able to get it to stop leaking. It is indeed nice not to have to add gasoline, start and stop a noisy gas motor....it is very easy to plug it in, hook up water, turn it on and go...just don't expect it to do the job of an industrial pressure washer. Cannot address the durability since it has been used only about 10 hours. On the other hand, many household chores are overdone with a high pressure washer: vinyl siding is easily scarred, wood decks are ruined, window screens are bent and concrete actually eroded by high pressure sprayers when the operator is not careful. This unit works great on everything you can reach from arm's length and washes it very well. Easy to use, easy to set up, does the job of a light/medium duty washer...reasonable price.",

I never even needed to use the highest pressure wand. In my driveway, I had to be careful to use lower power (wider spray) because the power is so much more than I needed. It might be too small in volume of flow to do, for example, the siding of a house in a reasonable amount of time. However, for jobs the size of a deck, a sidewalk, driveway, car, or boat it's just fine. No need for a bigger washer. It does leak a little bit where the garden hose is attached, but I'm getting everything wet, anyhow. I bought the extra coupling some people suggested, but so far it hasn't been necessary to stop the small leak at the attachment. The instructions have pretty clear pictures of setup, and if you follow them the parts go together ok, with only that one small leak. It's hard to read the written instructions, but the pictures convey the necessary information adequately. Once set up, the washer is simple and easy to use.

I've power washed my stucco, soffits, gutters and downspouts, and just today, I did my porch furniture. I've always had to use a bucket of water with soap and bleach, and tons of water from the hose. Today it took 1/4 the time, without the need for any of those. My furniture looks like new. I'm am so pleased. The only hassle is that when you're using it, the three hoses want to get all tied up together...a small price for such a great little machine. I went ahead and bought the the brass hose connector that everyone suggested, and installed it right away without even trying the plastic one that came with the washer. I also bought (at lowes) a connector with a turn off valve so that I didn't have to go to the hose outlet to turn off the water so that I could change wands. It works great too. So far I'm loving it, and searching out more things to clean. It's so easy to use...on, off, done. I'm not using the accessory piece since it looks like more hassle than it's worth. Just looping both the electric cord and the pressure cord and laying them over the top of the machine. I highly recommend this machine for anyone who hates the hassle of gas powered equipment.

The power cord is far longer than the storage on the back allows for, plus you'll take the skin off your knuckles bashing into the hose attachment every time you loop the cord, and it would take some sort of mutant power to get the very rigid hose to actually sit nicely on the reel as shown in the picture.

Second, I like the fact that the hose disconnects from the unit so that it can be stored during the winter months or easily replaced if needed. Prior to purchasing this unit, I purchased a CleanForce pressure washer from home depot. The pressure washer worked fine but after the winter was over, the hose had burst. This unit has an internal storage area for the hose. Although this is very convenient and stores nicely, the entire unit must be disassembled just to change the hose. The AR Blue Clean worked well and with over a thousand reviews, it appears to be a well tested machine.",

I was concerned about all the reviews regarding the leaking so I called AR directly to ask them about it and they shared that they upgraded the connector with a new quick release coupling that solved the problem. Once I got the unit I called AR back just to make sure I assembled the connectors correctly since the instructions still reference the old connector piece that had leaking problems. Angie walked me through the simple setup and I was off and running. The first time I connected the quick release coupling I had a little leaking at the connection point but I found later that it was because I did not have the hose connected tightly enough to the connector. Once I hand tightened the hose to the connector I did not have any more leaking. This product does not leak if you connect the pieces correctly! As far as performance, it was great. Good power, worked well on a 5 year old deck, made it look like new. I did have a lull in power on two occassions during about 4 hours of continuous use but it did not seem to happen again. I found that the cord and the pressure washing cable were quite long enough to reach my second story deck. The machine is also well constructed. The utility of the cord holders are questionable but again that is something that I expected as many reviews detailed this issue. The shipping only took 3 days instead of the estimated 7! I was able to knock out this project over the weekend.",

It cleaned up our mossy, moldy flagstone patio easily. Works great on the vinyl siding and I'm sure will work fine on washing the cars. It is easy to manipulate and plenty of pressure for household projects like cleaning outdoor furniture, garden pots, etc. Instead of having to change out couplings for different pressures which is a pain, this Washer uses a turn adjustment to regulate the PSI. It is female friendly but my husband also likes it because there is little hassle in using it and storing it. We do have two minor cons, it does take a few minutes to get it ready for use each time which really is no big deal and there is a plastic coupling that should be made out of metal. It is curious that Blue Clean would us this cheap fitting. Otherwise, we are very satisfied",

Well worth the extra $50 that it cost over the two I returned. A solid sounding motor that featurs a shut off when you release the trigger on the gun. I think an important feature. Concerning the leakage at the dual female connections: Some reviews suggested purchasing a brass double connector but I was able to get a good seal by just adding an extra soft washer in each end and it worked perfectly. No leaks. Why AR doesn't address the problem with the leaks that so many reviews mention is beyond me. This is a big time company in the pump business and I believe they have a good product here. The only thing that disappointed me was that they don't tell you that the soap dispenser is not pressurized. I thought it would be similar to the coin operated do it yourself car wash but it only serves as an applicator with little pressure.

            "review_text": "I saw a pressure washer being used to remove paint from a house next door. Their paint looked in good condition, so I figured it would be no problem removing flaking paint from our deck with a pressure washer. Unfortunately it only takes off the loosest paint chips. Even an inch from the wood, this pressure washer will just cause splintering and not remove paint/primer that's still got a good hold. The turbo nozzle actually removes the most paint and causes the least damage but it still leaves a lot of paint. I've since done more research and looked at videos and apparently 3000 psi is the recommended pressure for paint removal, but that's mostly so you can cover a wider area at lower pressure, not because you want the full 3000 psi to hit your wood from an inch away and splinter it. It seems most sites don't recommend hitting wood with over 1200 psi, and apparently pressure washing is typically used just to remove the loose paint and then you paint over what remains. So this pressure washer will do the job for that usage, but only in maybe 4-6 inch strips (guessing). Unfortunately I want to get off ALL the paint and stain the deck. I could have sworn the neighbours were getting off all the paint with a pressure washer, but maybe they were using a chemical stripper as well or maybe the siding was aluminium or sheet rock that could withstand higher pressure. Not wanting to use chemicals, I tried an orbital sander, an IR heating device, and later switched to using a Paint Shaver Pro which I'm loving. See my review of The Silent Paint Remover for details. The blue quick release nozzle that bridges from the house water hose to the washer does not work correctly with lower water pressure. Although my water pressure doesn't really seem very low, so maybe my quick release is just defective. Either way, with the blue quick release, the washer will work for a few seconds but then the pitch of the motor changes and the spray becomes much lighter as if it's half air. I replaced the blue quick release nozzle with a grey one that happened to be on another hose I had laying around and it works fine with that with the water spigot barely turned on. The only difference is the blue one has a sliding pin in it that is pushed open when connected to the washer but when disconnected it is held closed by pressure in the hose to keep the hose from spraying water when disconnected. I think the amount of water that can get past the pin may be too low. Since a lot of old customers complained about water leaking from the quick release because they turned their spigot on too high, this new quick release may have overcompensated by keeping the pressure too low. It looks like you could remove the pin by taking the quick release apart, but you would need to pry about a dozen tabs of plastic up to allow the housing to slide apart. The blue tabs are arranged in a ring holding onto a lip around a black pipe. Or you could just drill the pin out but then you couldn't return it. When I first used the washer it was dribbling enormously out the bottom of the machine and I thought I had a defective, leaking unit. It turned out that the water was coming out of the seal between the machine and the clear nozzle that connects to the quick release. The manual says to only hand tighten this nozzle to the machine, but even when I hand tightened it as firmly as I could it still leaked water copiously (the water dribbles down the machine and then appears to be coming out of the bottom of the machine). I had to get a rubber pad used to open jar lids to get a better grip on the clear nozzle to tighten it further. After that it hasn't leaked. I noticed today that after about five minutes of use, the power brick that connects to the wall plug was almost too hot to touch. This was after the machine had been turned off for at least five minutes. I hope that won't end up being a problem with longer usage.",

My pool copping and deck sparkled by the time I was done. But I was so excited about how clean they got I cleaned just about everything else with the pressure washer too... My BBQ grill got a good cleaning, the exterior walls of my house where my dogs brush up against is now clean, and the covered patio was rinsed down and now looks like the color it was meant to be. I think next weekend I'll wash the garage door and driveway. This was definitely a good investment. I hope it lasts. Oh, one thing to note is that the thing that reels up the hose sucks big time!

I did as others recommended and replaced the plastic hose connector with a brass one and red washers. Its pressure compares favorably to the much larger, more powerful, MUCH heavier models. I would consider it very portable. It has an extra long electric cord and nice long high pressure hose. The design flaw have to do with storage. The area where the electric cord is to be stored needs to be bigger - it barely fits. Also the plug is BIG and doesn't fit well were it is intended to -between the wound up cord and the unit. The input valve where you connect the high pressure hose so too close to the tool caddy, making it difficult to connect and, especially to disconnect, the hose for storage. Another issue with the tool caddy - it is very difficult to get the wands to snap into the tool caddy. I'm concerned the small brackets for the wands will break if I force the wands to fit. Finally, the detergent bottle is a joke...a big joke! My prior washer had an internal tank which was great! This is a great unit and would recommend it. It seems everything you buy there are always going to be design flaws. And, they may not appear that way to everyone.",

For storage I wrap electrical cord around wind-up reel (getting plug thru opening in reel takes a little effort) and hose around 3 guides on back (still not easy). A great unit for the price.",

It has a little more pressure and I like the adjustable wand better than the assortment of fixed nozzles the Costco unit had. Plus it seems like the motor is not laboring as hard. I've only had this for a month or two but I've been using it a lot during that time and there have been no leaks or any other problems. I thought there was a leak once but it was easily fixed by removing the quick disconnect and giving it a good hand-tighten and popping it back in. Since than I attach the quick disconnect to the garden hose first where it's easier to have a good grip, then pop it into the unit and there are no drips.",

They either fixed that problem or users were not hooking things up correctly. I've used it to clean the mold off vinyl siding and to clean the patio and deck around our pool. It worked great. It's very easy to change the attachments - just release the on / off trigger & make your change. No need to turn off water or unplug from the AC outlet. I used a zip-tie to create a lock for the handle tripper - no need to wear yourself out holding down the trigger. The only negative issue I've encountered is the soap dispenser. As others have reported the soap is not dispensed at high pressure / will not spray very far / is quickly emptied out. No problem - just use your hose & a Krud Cutter or similar dispenser for that part of the job. Highly recommended!",

I bought it to wash the aluminum siding on the house and it has done a very good job using only water, no detergents. In fact, I like it so much that I'm walking around the neighborhood looking for more siding to wash ;-) I've also used it to pressure wash a split rail fence, and a brick patio, again using only water, and I've been quite pleased with the results. I definitely recommend this pressure washer for home use.",

Is it as strong as an industrial pressure washer? Of course not. But it is great at what it does do! It is very easy to store, is convenient because it is electric powered, and does a great job at every day type cleaning. The only problem I have had is a loose fit where the hose connects resulting in leaking of water from around the fitting. It doesn't affect the performance or anything, but is the only negative I can find to say about it. Otherwise, it has worked well for almost 2 years and I would certainly buy again.",

It kept kicking off every few seconds after using for several minutes. I called the 800# for help with the AR Blue Clean company. They were very helpful and walked me through different trouble shooting things to try. After several different tries, the gentleman I talked to the last time said that it was a piece/circuit (I don't remember the exact thing he called it) under the cover that could be replaced if I wanted to try to take the plastic off of the front of the washer, or I could return for refund or exchange. I was not too sure about taking the pressure washer apart, he said that he would grab the exact model and take it apart and see how complex it was. He called back and said to go ahead and return the pressure washer. It happened to be more complex than he thought. So I had NO troubles Returning it. I went online and did the UPS pickup and I repacked the Pressure washer. The UPS came today NO TROUBLES with returning the product and UPS brought the label and took it for me. IT was very easy to return. I was very impressed with the help I got from the AR company. I know in any manufacturing plant, they sometimes have bad parts that get into the products. I have yet to reorder the pressure washer. They said this is the top selling model. There were no leaks and it did work pretty good for the first few minutes and then it would cut off. The piece would have fixed it and it would have worked fine the gentleman reasurred me... So I liked their time in explaining and listening to the product while I was on the phone with them. Very good customer service. I just happened to get a defective one. That happens. I gave 3 stars because they were great with service and I think it would have worked great if that piece inside the motor area would have been good, but it was defective so hard to give it higher star without actually trying one that works properly. I will have to let you know later about the pressure washer when we decide to get one. The power cord was a bit irritating to try to wind on the machine after use. The washer hose was in the way so I had to do some extra work in winding it up going around the water hose for each loop around the holder part. The manual could have been a little more instructive about the reel, but maybe it was good enough. The reel is just for storing when not in use. I did get it put together tho and there were no leaks in the plastic piece where the hose connected to the pressure washer. The plastic water piece on the front was sturdy and I didn't have any leaking at all. I didn't need any other pieces to make it not leak.

Some reviewers complained of water leaks- make sure you grease the o rings and this should not be a problem. Also, do not leave it out in freezing temps or you could have pump failure. On the negative side, the pressure hose is cheaply made. This was also the case with the low and midrange units at the big box stores. If the hose fails, I'll just replace it with a good one. Over all, I am very pleased with this machine. For light to moderate use, I didn't find another pressure washer with as much psi and gpm as this one along with so many positive reviews.

I unscrewed the connection, applied teflon tape and no more leaks. The wheels are too small to be of any use, so I wind up carrying it to move it.

And speaking of cords, the electric cord storage is terrible. Power-wise it is probably the rated psi. Since this is not powerful enough for much more than cleaning your siding or washing the car, you migt as well get one slightly less powerful and save $50.

As advertised it comes with two wands and a soap bottle. Both the electrical cord and water hose are fairly long, making so you don't have to lug the washer around too often. I did have some issues at first getting the unit running. The power plug kept tripping (has a built in breaker) for some reason. Switching to a different outlet seemed to fix it. After connecting everything and turning the water on, I did encounter leaking at the connector where the hose connects to the unit. It wasn't a terrible leak, but drips none the less. I'll probably buy a better brass connector as others have recommended. As far as pressure washer goes, the unit did a good job. It cleaned off 6+ years of gunk from my deck with little effort. It also cleaned the brake dust and grime from my car rims quite easily as well. As with all pressure washers, this guy does have enough power to cut into wood and other soft surfaces if using the fine point sprayer. The unit was powerful enough to even clean some surface stains on my concrete patio, but not strong enough for some of the deeper ones. One drawback with the trigger gun is no locking mechanism on the trigger. There is a safety switch so it can't be depressed, but you must hold the trigger down while spraying. Proabably a safety thing, but when holding the trigger for long periods it does make your hand a little tired. My main complaints are with the storage features of the unit. It has a built in hose roller and a plastic holder on the back to hold the nozzles and soap dispenser. The nozzles don't fit in the plastic holder very well at all and fall out. The hose roller also did not work very well. It kept hanging up on the hose, was hard to turn and kinked the hose in places. I opted to loosely roll the hose and just hang it over the unit. The height of the unit is a little weird too. It has a top handle and wheels to roll with, but the height of the unit is short. If you're 5'5\" or taller you have to hunch over a little to pull it by the handle. Overall, for the price, not a bad unit and it does work well for it's purpose of pressure washing.",

All the parts and acessories fit together as one unit and it is lightweight and easy to manouver. When it was finally warm enough to try it out I was very happily surprised with the way it performed. The combination of the long electric cord and the long hose made it so that I could wash a 60 foot long wall without having to stop and reconnect to a different electrical outlet. Its a little cumbersome with the three lines - tap hose, electrical line and pressure washer hose, but I will preplan my procedure more carefully next time to keep from getting tangled up. I was washing the painted cinder block wall to prepare it for painting and the pressure washer had sufficient force to stip loose paint and morter. The washer did everything I asked it to. I have used a gasoline motor pressure washer before, and although it had more pressure than this electric model it was way too cumbersome and heavy. This electric washer had more than enough pressure for my needs and was much easier to move and transport. I read some of the reviews about the problem fitting, so I also purchased the additional fitting on the same page on Amazon, but didn't need it. In fact, I don't know where it could be used. The manufacturer must have solved the problem because all fittings were fine and didn't leak. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a reasonably powerful, easy to move pressure washer.",

I used the AR Blue Clean to remove clay residue from the sidewalk and my parking space following some major plumbing work. I am so pleased with the performance and I didn't have to use a soap or added cleaner. It was relatively easy to put this thing together and get to work immediately. I was having so much fun, I did my steps and both my neighbor's sidewalk. I took off one star for the leak which I feel the company should have resolved by now.",

Then I saw the reviews for the AF Blue Clean AR383, 1900 PSI and liked what I was reading. Almost all of the reviews were positive. The only problems listed were ones with the connection from the hose to the power washer. I bought a quick connect metal attachment to solve this problem. Thanks reviewers for this tip. I am 65+ and disabled so I like the ease of electric equipment. I needed something that was fairly light weight, but would get the job done. I love the long wand and the long power cord. Since I got this power washer I have finished my house, 2 decks (these look like new), 2 sidewalks and 3 barns !! Oh... and a 32' travel trailer ! I will now winterize the machine and see if it works as great in the spring. The only thing I really don't use is the hose reel as it is more trouble than I want to deal with. I just wrap the hose up and put it over the handle.",

Maybe the motor is trying to heat up first or something after storage? It's just weird. After that initial few minutes, however, it works pretty good. 2. You can't press the trigger twice in a row rapidly. The second time you do that, the pressure washer will start humming without providing pressure at all. But if you let it stop for 2 seconds, you can press it again and get the pressure you expect (after the initial waiting period I described above). 3. The hose is rigid, inflexible, and feel cheap, which makes it harder to roll for storage. Pro: One of the best pressure you can get from electric pressure washer. Cons: See the three items I mentioned above.",

I have used gas power washers before and was hesitant to buy electric, however, being newly single decided to try it as I don't want the hassle of oil, gas, winterizing, etc. I was quite pleasantly surprised at how well it works! It works just as well as the last gas powered one I used! Compared to the typical residential gas power washer: 1) Lighter, easier to move around. Can easily pick up and carry. 2) Quieter...much quieter! 3) Attachments are much easier to switch. 4) Easier to use overall...trigger is easier to handle, etc. I just purchased a new construction home and cleaning mud and cement dust that had been rained on and stuck to the cement was a breeze. Dirt all over siding, paint on garage floor... all of it was a snap. Cons: It does leak at the filtered water inlet. I will just replace with brass connector and it should be fine. The gas powered one I was used to using always leaked at the water inlet too so I guess it didn't bother me as much as other people who have written reviews. Overall, very good power washer for the money!",

The only negative thing I can say about this unit is that it is a little flimsy. I can see why some other reviewers have replaced the hose fitting. Mine doesn't leak, but it does seem a little weak, so it wouldn't surprise me if it starts to leak at some point in the future. Also, as the other reviewers have said, the hose / cord reels are kind of a joke, it's easier to just wrap them around the handle. However, considering this is a few hundred dollars cheaper than a professional gas unit, these minor inconveniences are definitely worth the price savings in my opinion.

Used it to spray off paint on the floor of a covered porch (took right off) and a large wooden deck to prep for water sealer and it took that black slick mold right off that grows so well on wood in Florida (chemical treatments have been unable to touch in getting off for us) - great pressure.

Very easy to use and set up, the wand spray adjusts from very fine to a very wide stream, great for removing stains from cement to washing the car, really get's the brake dust off the wheels! The only negative I would give it is that the hose reel is to small and compact, you have to spend way too much time carefully winding it up after use because if you don't it kink's the hose as in my case and I was being very gentle winding it up.

Used both the wand attachment for cars and wood and the turbo for brick. Surprising how fast each cleaned the respective surfaces. Have to be careful with the force of the spray, however, as it can peel loose paint. No problem with the new plastic hose quick connect leaking. I liked the soap container as an attachment to the hose. This avoids clogging up the pump and water lines with soap residue---a drawback I discovered on another brand of washer. There are some drawbacks. The unit is too low to easily roll around on the wheels. The water hose is not very flexible and a little cumbersome to drag around while cleaning. Also the hose is difficult to roll on the reel. Took off one star for these minor cons. All in all, though, the AR Blue 1900 PSI is just what the doctor ordered for a Harry Homeowner to keep things clean around the outside, reasonably painlessly--especially if on sale below $150.",

He was scraping the paint off the front door yesterday and I suggested he bust it out.. He finally did and he didn't stop at the front door, he moved on to the front porch and sidewalk. After seeing the results, I wanted to try it. We easily moved it to the back patio, which faces north, so lots of muck to work on. Well, this thing is amazing, literally erases the grime. So rewarding to instantly see the browns and greens disappear before your eyes! My husband had to unplug it to get me to stop because it was getting too dark out. I can't wait to get back to it. We had no problems at all running it for four hours straight and although I didn't read the directions, it was very easy to operate. Husband assembled easily. I warned him about the amazon complaints on the plastic connector, but we had no problems. Love the angle adjustments right on the nozzle. Widespread was kickbutt, and you can narrow the stream for heavy, heavy duty like paint and grease on the cement. It is powerful, I was adjusting the stream flow while cleaning a wooden swing and I did tear through the wood with that sharp line of spray, so don't think that since it is not gas powered that it will be weak, because it can still do some damage! So glad I gifted this to my husband and so glad I didn't go with a gas powered one. If we have problems with longevity, I will edit review, but for the first initial run of four hours, I am hooked and in love!",

Washing poop off the cement, cleaning my porch, windows, walls and fence but its not as strong as I wanted it to be. next time I would go for a washer with more PSI. One of the attachments is stronger than the other which does a better job of cleaing poop, algae off the cement and bricks, you can even remove grass and other greens in between cracks. The only thing I don't like is that it looses its strength at about 1 foot, anyhthing farther and all it dies is blow leaves. But for my purpose its ok. The attachment for the hose does leak which gets everything wet, wish they would send a better one.",

It got every bit of dirt, mold, grime and everything else that wasn't supposed to be there away. I laid my porch mat on my driveway to clean and mistakenly went around the edges too. Well now I have a square cleaned on my driveway because right around the edge of the mat, it cleaned the driveway also. It's really awesome and I can't wait to do my entire driveway. I also used it to wash away those stubborn spider webs that were everywhere, clean the siding on the house and the outside of the windows. I LOVE my power washer!!",

I SUGGEST YOU READ THE ENTIRE MANUAL before using it and just take care of the product and it will work fine for you. I've used it for about 40 hours now, did a superb job on my picket fence and brought it back to life. My driveway and walkway look brand new and I am currently doing the house in preparation of painting it. Bought it on Amazon, cheapest price I found and it was delivered as scheduled.

I had a 3000 psi gas pressure washer that died some time ago. This electric washer is pretty impressive for its size and price. It is not a heavy duty unit - as a result it takes a lot longer to effectively clean a large area. It does leak at the hose and gun hose connections but I may have not tightened those enough - The effective spray area in only about an inch or two so it takes time to clean a larger area and the gun does not have a constant \"On\" button so after a while your hand gets sore from squeezing the trigger. I think I'll pick up a Velcro strap to keep the trigger depressed while using. This unit is great for things like washing a car, cleaning a few steps etc. but for a larger area I'd suggest renting a more heavy duty unit.

The unit is powerful yet not too bulky or heavy. I love the adjustable nozzle so you can change the spray pattern instantly, I would never buy a power washer without one! I have used both types of washers over the years and cant understand why some manufacturers dont offer the adjustable spray nozzle. Having to stop and change nozzle tips is just stupid and time consuming. I wanted a unit with a soap dispenser tank built into the unit but the number of units out there is very limited with this feature, so I went with this unit due to the good ratings and decent price. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the hose reel feature; it is worthless to use and not practical, I did like everyone else does and just coil the hose up around the machine. They could have easily added tabs so you could just wrap the hose up on the machine like a vacuum cleaner cord but what ever.

I even bought one of the used versions as a first-time experiment, and found it was actually brand new but perhaps had been returned (packaging only was defective). Another plus is that, while a gas-powered pressure washer I used chipped my privacy fence, this 1900 PSI cleaned the privacy fence perfectly without damaging it. I would recommend at this stage and will report back if something goes wrong in future. By the way, I deducted a single star since it is plastic and doe snot seem so durable, but will upgrade it later if it exceeds my durability expectations.

Clear instructions, decent pictures. All parts were shipped and easy to find. I did order a brass hose fitting but that has not arrived yet. Installed with plastic fitting supplied with machine and it functioned fine. No leaks. I agree with others that leaking problems are likely due to owner error. While I would have liked AR to supply a brass fitting, most or all of the washers in this price class use plastic so I did not knock down the rating for this. Just finished doing about an hour's cleaning on some VERY dirty/moldy sidewalk in the rear of my house. No, it's not a 3000 psi machine, but it did a good job. I'm looking forward to using this on more sidewalks, driveway and bricks. I also bought it to do some high windows that are beyond my climbing comfort. Almost forgot. I had a question about leaving the pressure hose connected between jobs. (The manual says to disconnect and put it on the reel.) I emailed the manufacturer and had an answer in under two hours! (It's OK to leave it hooked up, but it's recommended to disconnect it when storing for the winter.) There was even a name and phone number on the email! When you go to their web site, you can find email addresses for the entire management team. I like that. I'm very pleased with this early experience. Will update if my opinion changes. Update: Have a few more hours of use and still very satisfied. Called AR customer support to see if they offered a brass hose connector. They said they recently replaced the plastic single piece connector with a two piece quick-connect. Because I had a nearly new unit, they are sending the new connector to me UPS at no charge.

It worked almost out of the box (assembly is minimal). The adjustable nozze wand works great so I am able to go from mild to wild without changing orifices. The only criticism is that the detergent application must be made with the low-pressure bottle, you cannot siphon-mix the detergent into the high pressure stream. It's a mild complaint, over all, I'm happy with the unit. Oh, it does occasionally stop spraying--just \"playing\" with the trigger to pulse the stream usually gets it back working.

The manufacturer, realizing that most people don't read manuals, included a \"Quick Start Guide\" which was not very specific when it came to explaining how to (and how NOT to) attach the various hose pieces.

Compact, easy to use, great to put away. (You know what I mean by this: rather than having a hose and a power cord that sort of \"hang off\" the thing when it's being stored, the AR has cleverly designed this one to have places to secure both of those items, along with the wands and the attachments. Bravo.) It gets a fair amount of use, from our patio deck to the pool filters...that alone pays for one of these...and it's held up just fine over the summer, without any of the engine problems or leaks that I've encountered with other brands. The reason I'm writing now, though, is because they just impressed the heck out of me with their customer service. Using the washer, I accidentally tipped it over, and the coupling for the garden hose cracked. Even though the damage was my fault, when I emailed AR to order a replacement piece, they responded almost immediately that they'd happily replace the part for free. Can't remember the last time I came away from a customer service interaction quite so satisfied. Thank you, AR: you make a solid product, and you stand behind it.",

This little machine worked better than the gas operated unit we just put out on the curb for trash night. We put some detergent in the provided container and sprayed it on the siding. Waited a few minutes and then used the adjustable wand to easily wash away the mildew. We used the turbo wand to easily cut through the grime on the cement pad of the car port. My wife loved using it too. We found cleaning with this unit to be addictive because it cleans so good. I think maybe my pressure washing days are over because she loves using it and seeing the great results. It's great not dealing with gas and fumes. We have exterior power oulets on all 4 sides of our house so the length of the power cord was not an issue. I believe extension cords do not work with this unit. We experienced no leaking from the unit. It's quick and easy to set up and put away. We didn't bother trying to reel up the washer hose or loop up the power cord on the holder. We just looped them up and hung them on the handle. We are so happy we made this purchase. Would rate more than 5 stars if it were permitted.",

Very disappointed I turned it off and emailed customer service ( it was after hours of course) I explained the situation to the representative and he requested a copy of my original purchase receipt and a new one was sent to me in 1week no questions no arguments. The representative was very courteous and friendly made a bad situation somewhat pleasant. Although I did not have a lot of time with the machine it did seem to have ample power to do your everyday cleaning I'm not sure it has the power to tackle the very difficult jobs. I am using my new one today I am hopeful it will make proud!!!!!",

The handle is a bit short for me and I'm only 5'7 so a collapsible handle would be a smart change it only comes up to my knee. Lastly the quick connect water hose leaks. Not the quick connect itself but the adapter to the garder hose. For a quick fix just use plumper's thread tape and its good. Now for the good part. The machine has a great fit and finish. Feels solid not like a cheap machine at all. The pump operation is quiet compared to others I have used. The pressure is higher than most by 400 psi. The gun attachments are also solid. The soap sprayer is a great to for spraying soap over a large area. Its not a pressurized soap sprayer it sprays softly. All attachments except the soap dispenser store on the back of the machine with specially designed holders including a holder for the spray gun with the wand attached when your using. Over all the mechanical and fit and finish are top notch just needs to work on some design. I'm very happy with this machine for the price.",

Fortunately, I have a large gauge extension cord to get to the outlying areas - distance from an outlet is a disadvantage with an electrical unit. The water and hose connections are not that convenient and you have to bend down and wiggle or play with the connections on the pump to hook-up the unit when you use it but, otherwise it is convenient - lighter than I expected. The electrical cord has a place to wrap but that is more trouble than it is worth - just rolling the cord up ad draping it over the handle is handier. The pressure seems just right for a wooden deck cleanup. Not to heavy to tear the wood up but strong enough to clean it very well. I used a liquid cleaner first with the applicator that came with the pump - that's handy. Has done a great job on the pavers and stone.",

The new PW arrived, I set it up as directed and used it for 3 days, 2--3hours/day without a problem. Worked great on cleaning my driveway, the brick walkway and the cars.

No, actually seriously, almost. I just googled their website and they have their contact info all right there; I emailed and explained the issue.

On this side of Oahu its very dry and everything gets covered in a red dust and this pressure washer had no problem knocking it off. I found cleaning is a lot easier using the solution attachment first, I use the Zep all purpose pressure washer cleaner (Zep is always nice and cheap and really gets the job done). I pretreated with the solution then changed wands and sprayed the house down and all the dust and grime came off real quick. Also used it to wash my truck, and it made it quick and easy work with the same process pre-treating with the solution, quick sponging then spraying it down with the pressure washer and it worked great. I haven't had any problems with any of the attachments, hoses, or connectors. I have no leaks and it is super easy to get the unit into operation.

The regular nozzle is safe enough to use on my hanging chandelier porch lite and even rinsing off my car. The 1900 psi high-pressure nozzle is great for special jobs like algae removal. I was concerned about using any chemicals near my landscaping vegetation, so am happy that this unit works fine without any additives. Make sure you wear appropriate attire, this unit works great, but the process can be pretty messy! This item would have gotten five stars except for the plastic coupler and sketchy instructions. All in all, a great product, and definitely I would do it all over again!",

            "review_text": "I just got done using the AR383 electric power washer for the first time. I am extremely impressed with its performance! Two weeks ago I used a gasoline powered washer to remove dead moss off a porch and sidewalk at my sisters house. It was rated at 3000 psi and worked quite well. Today I used the AR383 on my sidewalks which had dead moss buildup for the last several years. This washer removed the moss just as good as the more powerful washer did and was much quieter. Plus I didn't have to stop and fill a tank with smelly gasoline half way through the job. So far I am very happy I purchased this pressure washer. Oh yes, I almost forgot, I have one minor quibble. You need to insert a washer in the water hose connector before hooking up the hose. If you don't it will leak badly. I think they should include that washer. Luckily I had an extra washer to insert and it stopped the leak.",

The unit fired up on the first try and I was up and running right away. The pressure was pretty good - I'm not stripping any wood or anything hardcore with it, but it was effective for home use overall. I hit the rims on my car with the pressure nozzle and it took the winter grime right off! Effortless! We also have an oil spot on the driveway. We sprayed at it for a while and got a decent amount off. Then I rand to Menards and got some degreaser cleaning solution and put that in the bottle that came with the unit - that seemed to help quite a bit.

I disconnected it and looked at it, loosen the adaptor off the hose and reconnected. This time I made sure it was all the way screwed into the adaptor. Put it back on and no leaks at all. So make sure you have tighten it all the way down. Just hand tighten it down! After that, it worked beautifully, no high pitch noise at all, pump motor kicked in when ever I pressed down on the trigger and turned off when I released the trigger. It works great removing the dark black algae and dirt build up on the concrete and the green to dark green algae on the brick. I used the adjustable nozzle head. Was at it for at least an hour, turning it on and off as I was finishing and working my way around the outside of the hose. THe only minor inconvenience was that the pressure line felt a bit rigid when moving about but still totally workable. Would recommend to others.

Being careful kept it from damaging the concrete but, if the nozzle is too close, it starts to eat away at the concrete. It will clean wood but it isn't as fast as the gas models I have rented before. Both will splinter the wood if it's old or if you get in too close. A few cons: Ensure that the nozzle wand is securely in place and locked. The bottle attachment could use a little handle to make it easier to use. It takes a little longer than gasoline powered models and the spray width isn't as broad. Then again it's 1900PSI and not 3500PSI!

I have used an environmentally safe cleaning solution beforehand to lightly scrub the sidewalk, then the pressure washer finishes the job. Sidewalk is very clean now. TIPS: The hose connection to the unit leaked when I first connected it finger-tight. I used plumber tape on all the male threads (can be bought at Home Depot) and tightened all connections with a pair of vise grips. CAUTION - do not attempt to overtighten any platic fitting, only snug tight (can't loosen with fingers) will be just fine. Also, I use a 3/4-inch garden hose,and only turn water spigot on about 1/2 turn (we have strong water pressure from the city). Leaks stopped after doing this. I also use a no. 14 outdoor rated 50-foot extension cord. Wand connection requires a little muscle to get it disconnected, but if you use the same tip all the time, you do not need to do this. I really like the fact that the motot and pump shuts off when you release the trigger. I would recommend purchase of this product. John F, Concord, NC",

I've been through 3 new handles now, and it's particularly annoying when you put it away working, take it out to work on a deadline, and the darn high-pressure hose starts popping off the handle at the drop of a hat making it unusable. My advice is to keep a handle (replacement part costs $20) spare with the unit, so you're ahead of the game when it breaks on you. Apart from that it's a great little power-washer.",

But since then I was not able to start it. The machine was dead. I called AR Blue and explained the issue. One person from the company scheduled a troubleshooting session over the phone with me, but found the machine is dead (burnt out). Since there was still some days left on the warranty, AR Blue immediately processed the warranty and send me an exactly same new replacement washer. It arrived on time, and it works great as my old one (before it burnt out). I really appreciate the way AR Blue customer service handled the issue, including processing the warranty.",

I then took it to my friends house and cleaned the mold from her siding, cleaned the concrete walk and steps and the concrete foundation on the house, It worked like a charm. Of course you need to hold the nozzle at a close proximity to the surface and move in smooth sweeps to get a clean pattern. You get splatters of water on you, but that's expected.

I didn't read it well enough and I made a snarky-to-possibly-neutral tone reply and 10 min later, called them. I was told the clear plastic connector was metric and needed to be attached to the machine. The black and green connector attaches to the hose. Easy fix. Here's the important part. I was impressed by their customer service! I got a timely reply and they didn't point out that I was an idiot (I told them I was when I thanked them and apologized for not carefully reading their answer) but instead, were kind. Wow, what a big difference from some companies (like Roku, who fought me tooth-and-nail when they overcharged me $20 on my 4th device purchase.

Weather broke last week so I decided to give a try, has quick connect for house water side leaks alittle but bought female/female to solve that problem, but for now it does just fine. took the advise of another blog and use either vasoline or white multi purpose lube on fittings ( every other time). I've used the ar 383 for a total of about five hours, with few rest stops and works great! Not as fast as gas, but be patient gets the job done no scrubbing! Also the reel a good idea, but it's much easier to just wrap both electrical cord and hose by hand and use twist tied then hang over handle, stores just great that way! cons: Unit is alittle light so when pushing on/off button hold on to machine or might flip over. If this unit holds up for a couple of years or more it will be worth the money! A little common sense will go along way!",

I wouldn't need the additional power of a gas model. A nice feature is that the motor shuts off when when you release the trigger; unlike a gas model which would continue to run. That makes it easy to stop for other tasks without worrying about the gas motor running. Note, one common complaint I saw was with the leaky water hose connection. As of my first use, I did not see any leaks. Another complaint was the stiff pressure hose. I did find that to be correct. I'll wait to see if it relaxes after more uses.",

So much so, most of my family asks me to look into items they are considering for Christmas, b-days, etc. Knowing that electric pressure washers have progressed considerably in the recent past, I thought I would give one a shot. I had no expectations that an electric unit would provide as much power as an equivalent gas unit. However, I was only needing it for light duty house stuff (i.e. small patio and deck, a little vinyl siding, and some window cleaning). The reviews for the AR383 appeared to be pretty solid so I gave it a shot and purchased it in March. Upon receiving the unit I got it all hooked up appropriately and began to clean some windows. I was generally happy with the initial pressure and operation of the unit. After about 8-10 mins of use, the motor began to rumble and overheat along with a noticeable loss of pressure. I stopped and let it cool down. I returned about an hour later and began again. The motor overheated again and smoke began to rise out of the unit. The highly identifiable smell of smoldering electronics/motors was present as well. The unit was done for. Thinking I got a bad motor, I contacted Deerso and the manufacturer. Both customer service reps offered to send a second unit at no charge and stated I could keep the first one for parts if I wanted. 2nd unit arrives in short time and I fire it up again. Exact same result as the first unit. In both cases I made it a point to ensure that a constant cold water source was fed to the unit, so at this point I am fairly confident that the motor unit is poorly engineered and/or constructed as the cooling system is obviously faulty. Deerso, AR North America, and Amazon all handled the issue incredibly timely and professionally. A full refund was issued including the shipping costs. With the number of great reviews for this product, I can't say that it is a poor product. However, I can say that the 2 units I received were complete lemons. If you want to give it a shot and don't mind the minor inconveniences associated with the refund/return process then go for it. I can attest that Deerso and AR North America will assist if you have problems. Hopefully you will receive a better unit then I did.",

Pretty quiet in comparison to my old Karcher unit and the extra pressure makes jobs go quicker. Cleaned a 75 ft x 12 foot deck and the same length of concrete with some staining on it. Definitely purchase the Nelson Industrial Brass Pipe and Hose Fitting with Dual Swivel for Male Hose to Male Hose, Double Female 50574 mentioned in other reviews. That makes connecting your hose easy and doesn't damage the connector on the unit. The host reel and the cord storage make this easy to store and it's probably a good 15 lbs lighter than the Karcher unit was, so storage is a breeze. Used it twice so far, once for heavy duty cleanup and the second time was a quick cleanup. Worked great both times.",

With 1900 psi, it was effective - not as quick as a more powerful gas unit but did a good job in a reasonable time. I would like to have a longer hose, but found the unit light and easy to move around. The only thing I had a little difficulty with was the lower bracket in back used to wind the power cord around. It is situated very close to the pressure hose connection, and I had to remove the bracket to get a firm grip on the hose to screw it in place. Then I replaced the bracket and will leave the hose connected between uses. I was very pleased and am looking forward to more jobs with it. Nice unit and easy to assemble.",

Making the whole deign useless. Customer Service asked me to wind the power cord and the hose around the washer since they will not fit in anywhere else . I am truly surprised that this is the BEST SELLER , I have no idea why my fellow buyers have rated it 5 Star . The quality of construction is flimsy & cheap. The pressure gun is poorly designed & causes fatigue compared to other brands - this is also because of the rigid hose .

Unfortunately, the hose would not connect to the washer. Epic fail and waste of 3 precious hours on a Sunday. I hope AR changes the lock mechanism on the gun. It looks like it could be a decent unit.

Also, the dials on the nozzles really do not give you a lot of choices. At least mine does not.

The oscillating one is perfect for washing cars and doing light work. The smaller tip is great for more stubborn stains, but takes longer since the pattern is more concentrated. As usual, the shipping (free super saver) was timely and didn't take but a couple of days. All the parts seemed durable (many plastic.) The high pressure hose is a durable rubber, smaller in diameter. The only thing I didn't think was overly great was the hose reel, which is only for storing the hose, not for use during washing.

Used almost non-stop for 2 days without any issue cleaning pool cover, wood deck and concrete with years of build-up. Did not use the accompanying cleaner container as the water pressure alone was enough. The cost of the unit was effectively 2 day rental for gas unit so already paid for itself. Granted the time it takes to do the same job is marginally longer due to water force but much lower noise and operation ease. Good construction, hose to wand doesn't easily kink, garden hose connection is solid. The small hose reel is a bit cumbersome, good for longer term storage but easier to just drape the hose over the handle if going to use frequently.",

The bad news is the instruction sheets are really rather poor, repetitive and confusing. Many thanks to the reviewer that subitted a photo with a comment since there is no way I would have been able to figure out the hose attachment without a phone call to the manufacturer otherwise. The power cord and the pressure hose are also a little awkward, but not so bad that I would take off more than one star. Bottom line is that this is not a bad purchase for lighter cleaning jobs and it will take additional time and effort for heavier dirt. This is after all an electric, residential type washer.",

It worked great for about 12-15 uses over the span of 1.5 years. Since I didn't use my washer that much, I was satisfied with the way it operated when I did use it. Then in the spring of 2013, I decided to wash off the siding of my house; during the first 10 minutes of use, it suddenly started pumping only at 50% and the pump started smoking. Now, every time I use the machine, it does the exact same thing. I now have a ~900 psi pressure washer that smells horrible. The warranty is only 1-year, so I'm out of schlitz for a replacement. If I could go back to 2011, I would have bought a gas-powered washer instead.",

I'm not talking about where the water hose plugs in the front. Its the back connection for the washer gun. It is so hard to fit your hands around it to unscrew it, especially with the hose holder right next to it. And after building up a lot of pressure, its actually harder than you think to unscrew it, even more so when you can't fit your hands around it.",

The unit wire for AC plug and the hose is a bit cumbersome as there is no place for it to be wound back (on the unit) after use for storage (the photo on box is deceiving in this regard).

Since its only a 1.5GPM unit and 1900 max psi, you have to have a pretty narrow band and be close to your work to make a big impact. So if your doing little jobs around the house, or don't mind spending an afternoon and a 6 pack cleaning your driveway then this will work just fine. I personally think pressure washing your driveway and watching it go from horrid to awesome is extremely gratifying, even if it took a six pack and a whole afternoon. :)",

The instant gratification of watching the dirt, grime, and moss come off to reveal beautiful clean stone was actually quite fun. My wife came out to see what I was doing and was begging me to use it. In fact when I went back out the next day to wash more of the stone, she basically demanded she do it because she enjoyed using the washer so much. I highly recommend this washer for the home owner.",

The only way this unit can meet your needs for washing a home is if you are cleaning a one story house with a hipped roof. If you have gabled roof ends then you should pass on this unit. After my first use of this machine, I found myself disappointed in many ways. There is not enough power for cleaning at heights above ten feet. The soap container is a joke. Be sure to have a funnel handy for loading cleaner because the opening is tiny. Most disappointing is the pathetic distance that soap is propelled from the unit. My unit did not leak at all which is an issue many buyers report in their reviews. I did experience the common poor hose storage reel. One seriously surprising disappointment is that you can not use an extension cord with this unit. I am surprised this issue does not show up in more reviews. You will need at least one exterior outlet on each side of your house to reach all four side on an average sized house. Evidently the GFCI will fail if an extension cord is used which could result in electric shock for the operator causing serious injury and possible death according to the manual. I have one exterior outlet so I was limited to cleaning 25% of my home. This issue alone made the machine a total failure for my intended use. If you are considering this unit for washing a car or general household use then it may be a good choice for you but if washing the exterior of your home is your goal then I would pass on this unit.",

I put it on the hose with my hand and it requires wrench's to take off. Even if I tighten with wrench's, leaks water real bad. Then the electrical cord holder at the back, unless you are perfect at wrapping the wire, it won't stay in the holder. At least they left some space behind it you can use.

The assembly is easy--read the instructions and follow the pictures. Handy little package with the electrical cord and hose wind onto the unit and areas to hold the wands when not in use.

Great for pressure washing concrete and siding and lighter jobs. Surprisingly great in fact. Not very great at something like wood decks. Get a gas powered pressure washer for those. There are a ton of small pieces and parts that go along with it, which can get somewhat confusing, but there are a lot of configuration options which makes it very useful. It's sufficiently easy to use that I was able to enlist my six-year old to help out in attempting to power wash my deck.

This model is easy to set up, easy to move around, easy to store. The end results made me stand back and admire the look of the siding, deck, walk way.

I have NO problems with leaks using the supplied connectors. I ran it for about 5 hrs. yesterday cleaning my barrel tile roof. The extension hose is great for doing roofs. The reason I did not give it 5 stars, because the storage for the accessories is poorly designed. Also the handle is very low making you stoop to pull it. Have not received the 10\" deck cleaner yet. Looking forward to using this on my concrete driveway .",

I carefully attached the garden hose adapter that comes with the unit, and it did not leak at all in use.

It has a built in GFIC which makes it hard to plug into an outlet that has a protective cover on it. Not the best design IMHO.

I like the automatic shut-off when the trigger is released. There is only one negative in my opinion and that is the garden hose connection. A pet peeve of mine is plastic on metal connections. Sooner or later the plastic threads are likely to strip. Like others that have commented here I simply replaced the default hose connection with a $6.00 brass garden hose \"swivel\" brass fitting(female to female) from Home Depot.

We were able to clean our wooden fences, patio furniture, concrete patio, driveway, windows, walls and take moss off the north side of our roof. Love how we were able to get so much done in just one day!",

I gave it four stars for the benefit of the doubt, but I'm usually spot on with judgments in quality and durability.",

The pressure hose can be left attached to the high pressure outlet and still wound on the reel or conversely, the wand can be left attached and the hose wound onto the reel by starting with the other end of the hose. I prefer to leave the hose attached to the outlet. Concerning the connector, while it is plastic, it works very well as long as it is screwed on the machine tight. I had to tighten it twice before it stopped leaking. The power cord is about the same length as my previous washer but the pressure hose seems a bit shorter. The pump end of the pressure hose appears to be a standard one so it should be possible to add an extention. There is a warning in the manual not to leave the motor running without water flow but this appears to be fixed as it also says on another page that it has a flow detector which shuts off the pump when you release the trigger and this is the way it works. The manual says the washer is warranted for 1 year (gun and hose 90 days)but does not say where to register it. I called the company and they told me they would honor the warranty as long as I had the receipt even if it wasn't registered but I could register it on their web site. I haven't used the spray wand yet but the turbo wand works great. Well worth the money!",

The \"turbo nozzle\" is phenomenal--breaks up and removes layers of mildew, moss and grime that had set into my patio tiles. While I've only used it for a short time so far, I'm alredy \"sold\" on it over the gas unit I would have otherwise rented due to its light weight, power and reasonable price. Plus I have it when I want it. Several of the prior posts reported that the supplied plastic garden hose to washer connector leaked, with the solution being to purchase a brass fitting from the hardware store. I clicked on the Amazon \"linked\" brass connector and thought I was being smart in buying this too. Well, I found that you are fine with what AR supplies as long as you make sure that you insert all of the washers they supply (a hose washer inside each end as well as the washer/filter on the hose side)!! It didn't leak a drop. Oh well, I'll keep that brass fitting for some emergency around the yard in the future.

I figure this must have been shipped with some water present from testing and then was stored in a location where it froze and split open inside. I doubt if this type leakage would not be noticed while being made. I would have ordered a replacement but after reading other reviews I realized there seems to be a high rate of failures on other units and most right out of the box. I therefore requested a return for refund. I will look locally tomorrow for a replacement. Thanks to Amazon's no hassle return policy I am at least able to for-go any out of pocket expense.

I didn't want to deal with a gas unit, but my bad experience with this product made me take a leap, and I'm sorry I wasted my money on this. Pros: ++ None, really. Compact, maybe? E.g. it fits in your trash can really well!! Cons: -- Not powerful enough for me to perform basic tasks such as cleaning siding or concrete. It's only good for light duty cleanup such as dirt removal from a patio, patio furniture, or a car. -- You need to really focus on a small spot to get any type of deep cleaning accomplished and at that rate it takes forever to accomplish anything. Not worth your time or your money! -- I'm also disappointed in how long it takes to set the unit up and break it down. Several minutes of screwing around with the clunky contraption. -- The hose reel is a pain in the neck to operate and my hose has sharp bends in it from trying to use the hose reel. -- The power cord storage grooves barely fit the power cord, then you're left with no where to put the \"wall wart\" on the end of the cord. -- Make sure you put the pieces away in a specific order, otherwise you need to unravel everything to fit the pieces in the unit: 1) pressure hose, 2) chemical container (this secures the end of the pressure hose), 3) power cord, 4) accessories. -- The wall wart keeps you from plugging this into typical outdoor receptacle protectors. You need a power cord pigtail to plug it in. I used this product: 1-foot extension cord -- The unit frequently gets overheated or something, which requires me to fully shut down the unit and restart. I also need to keep releasing the front garden hose connector to break a seal or something. It's all under pressure and a pain to adjust constantly. -- You need to wait a few seconds in between releasing the trigger and pressing again. It's an odd timing you need to adhere to in order to effectively use the unit. -- The cleaning inductor never worked well for me and it's extremely messy. Poor design.",

The foamer/detergent bottle is an utter piece of garbage. Infact, it damaged my car when the pressed in nozzle tip came flying off under pressure on the second use and put a dime sized dent in my car. It eats through soap like a fatman at a free all you can eat. The hose reel is horrible. The idea was there, they just didnt execute it correctly. Once again, lack of a better and actual word, the reel was dewflotchy. Its an utter pain to get it on there correctly and straight anreeling it on while reeling or spooling. Last but not least, the washer broke on the brass end that connects to the bottom of the hose. On my third attempt at using the unit, im half way through washing my car when im suddenly sprayed with pressured water from the bottom of the wand. On inspection, the rubber o ring washer that goies on the brass tube had split. Three uses. Two month period. Dont waste your time or money.. Spend 50.00 or 60.00 more.",

But after unpacking, assembling, then turning it on, I got an unpleasant surprise. TWO things were wrong, the first probably correctable with a call to the manufacturer's customer service, and the second I suspect was more in the nature of a design defect that I didn't want to have to contend with in the coming months and years. First, the small problem: One of the wand attachments that came with the unit didn't make a tight fit with the part of the handle to which it was supposed to attach. The consequence? Low water pressure, and a VERY leaky high pressure hose. I compared it to the wand attachment that DID fit well, and the two were NOT the same. Lack of inspection? Draw your own conclusions. Second, the possible design defect: The high pressure hose attaches to a \"gun\" through a coupling, which is held in place with a spring. The spring is SO WEAK, that the high pressure of the water, combined with the normal movement of the hose during use, caused the high pressure water hose to come detached from the gun, creating an H2O mess which sent me scrambling for both the power switch and the water spigot cutoff valve. No fun. The GOOD news? For the few seconds that it DID work with the wand that fit, the thing kicked butt. So, I'm off to the wild blue yonder of Amazon search and/or the Internet to look for another unit, maybe a gasoline-powered unit that costs a bit more. I live in the SF Bay area, and I hate to spew petroleum carbons into the air if I can help it, but....",

Then, when I went to use it the 4th time, the pressure started dropping and smoke started coming out of the motor. That was it for me. Of course, it was no longer under warranty. A piece of junk. Save up your money and buy a different, better one. Follow up on this product: After contacting the manufacturer of this product to make them aware of the sprayer's problems, the manufacturer told me they would replace the unit eventhough it was 6 months out of warranty. After sending them a copy of the original receipt, a new sprayer was sent at no cost. Still, I don't recommend this product because of my initial experience with the first one. Too many problems in too short of a time. Maybe others have had better luck though.",

It was beginning of September and I needed to complete the task quickly before cooler seasonal weather started. I completed the task BUT NOT WITH THIS POWER WASHER.Unfortunately for me, I didn't send it back quickly so I missed the Sept 29 date for return eligibility. Now I am stuck with a non-functioning power washer pLus no refund ($160) and I had the additional cost of purchasing items to get the job done. Lesson Learned: Act quickly to get replacement or refund. I was more concerned with getting job done than Amazon deadlines. I have Amazon prime and have enjoyed it.

After a few minutes with the \"Adjustable Wand\" the end of the wand was blown off by the pressure. It would not thread back on the wand. Inspection showed a 1\" piece of plastic thread inside which had been torn off or cut by the pressure. removal of the debris allowed the nozzle cover to be reattached. After a few minutes the unit started sputtering and changing pressure output. A couple of times it even shut off and restarted. It was as if it could not get enough water, but I have 90- PSI and a 3/4\" hose supplying it . Also no extension cord and plugged into a 20 amp circuit. So not power related. I have been a contractor for many years and have had several pressure washers. This one was for my wife so she would not have to start a gas unit. Price is important and I shopped price. If you make a product you can not cut the price by using material so cheap as to render the product useless. The wands are pretty cheap. I suspect some of the reviews are imposters.",

The machine is excellent. I had a fun time placing all the items together and it was nice to have an entire system on one platform. I even bought a few 50 foot super hoses of which one is just for the washer. I have that on the handle too. I think this machine is as good as anyone could ever need to maintain their home. I especially liked the way the system totally shuts down leaving the trigger off. No compressor running, no water leaking. It becomes totally silent so you could even answer a cell phone easily!!! I also cleaned my entire screened in porch which is right next to the pool and my water bill was only 2 dollars higher than the month before. The electric was about 4 dollars higher but is hard to compare because it was much warmer the month I used the system. My assumption was 2 to 3 dollars because I like my home warm here in Florida at 84 degrees. I use ac just to keep it dry inside and have no problem with heat at all. I only used water and no cleaning chemicals which is even nicer. I will redo it again this year with a little bleach to get a few togher stains out. The machine cleaned everything I expected it to in about 3 hours of heavy use and the decks and porch is lovely as when it was 25 years newer. This is only the second time I have ever pressure washed it and a gas motor was deafening and smelly. Never again. AR Blue Clean is the WAY @ GO for me for sure. I would buy this again in 1 minute!!!!!!! I love this machine. I will next get the preservative for the inside of the machine to store it between uses.

The reviews were good (both on and off Amazon) and for ten minutes it was doing a fine job (for a home use electric). Then it sounded like it lost back pressure internally and the motor didn't shut off when I let go of the trigger. I turned it off immediately and checked hoses and connections for leaks. I held the trigger, with the unit turned off, for a few minutes to see if any air would bleed out and none did. I turned it back on, nothing. Pulled the trigger and it ran for about five seconds, lost pressure and then shut off never to come alive again. I let it sit overnight and tried a second time but it wouldn't even make a sound. I am going with another brand as I have no confidence in this one.",

I had the ones from Costco for years I means 15 year or so and went thru just two of them, but Costco doesn't sell power waters anymore. I go the unit and it cried out Cheap, Cheap, Cheap piece of cr... So buyer beware if you get this one you will only have yourself to blame. Here is the good and bad about my unit. Used it once when I got it washed 3 cars and I rated it just passable. Then I put it away, you know most people do not use them a lot or often It was just turning cold and would not have used it again for maybe 5 months but I need to clean the driveway in one spot, So I hooked it up and like other the motor was DOA. I tried to return it but Amazon said I was 4 days passed the allowed time. After very little time Amazon agreed it should still work and did take it back, but if I hadn't used it the second time it was have been 5 months later I would have been screwed. Thank GOD for Amazon So if you still go ahead and buy this unit and it dies on you like me and others after one time of using it, remeber that little bird on your shoulder will be singing he told me so. No kidding there are always defective products form time to time but you know if it looks like a duck, sounds, like a duck, and walks like a duck it's a duck and CHEAP is CHEAP I did just get my new one from Amazon it cost more but you DO get what you pay for the Powerworks 51102 1700 PSI Electric Pressure Washer 1.4GPM with Quiet Induction Motor screams from well made and looks like it will last forever. Remember I wasn't looking for the lowest priced unit but a GOOD unit at a fair price and I found it Good luck to you all",

AR has recently updated their product, however, and you no longer need this additional connector to eliminate leaks. They now have a clear plastic connector with a male quick disconnect end that screws onto the pressure washer. This connects to the female quick disconnect end which is the black&blue connector that connects to your garden hose. You can see this better in the one customer image that Laurie submitted. I also used pipe thread to attach the clear connector onto the pressure washer. With this set-up I had no issues with any leakage at the pressure washer or at the quick disconnect. I used the washer to clean my concrete patio and brick areas of the house. It did a great job cleaning both. Only used it one time, but I'm impressed by it so far especially for the price. After using the pressure washer, I ran some Karcher pump saver into it. Since I'm not sure when I will use it again, this will help ensure the seals don't dry out. Hopefully this helps the pressure washer last years.",

Yes, they do drip slowly, but it isn't anything major and, let's face it, you are going to be blasting water everywhere such that a small pool of water by the machine isn't really relevant. I don't know about the longevity of the included plastic quick connect, but since it is plastic it will likely need to be replaced. However, it includes a visible filter to prevent dirt and rocks from getting into and harming the pump mechanism itself which the brass replacements don't seem to have. So, I have to say I am on the fence come replacment time whether to go with brass or just buy another plastic OEM one for $7. As for the unit, the reviews here are spot on. Quiet, about as powerful as one gets for an electric and seemingly well-made (albeit in China). Customre service seems excellent and the power is enough for cars, vinyl siding (second floor needs a ladder to really clean well), fences, etc. I tried cleaning slate with algae and stains and the results were mixed with either of the nozzles. Gas powered washers are more powerful, but in my experience, can actually go beyond cleaning into the realm of stripping away the top layers of things. On slate and concreted, that is probably fine, but for my uses on siding, cars, chairs, etc., it is probably better off that this machine doesn't perform that level of potential damage. When using around windows and other plastic items, reduce the pressure on the wand because one can do a bit of damage to items like plastic flowerpots. All in all, very capable and worthwhile machine for the average homeowner. Enough power to do 90% of what needs to be done.",

First, before ever using the washer I had to go out and buy a new garden hose adapter because the water was pouring out and it really decreased the water pressure. Then after using it once, a flimsy clamp that connects the high pressure hose to the gun broke. I had no idea that I would not be able to use the washer without this small plastic piece. If this piece breaks you have to replace the entire gun, although my gun is practically brand new. Since this gun in not available in stores you have to order and wait for it to be shipped. This is a big waste of time and money and I feel it's a way for the manufacture to make more money by making such a critical part so insubstantial. I went to Lowes twice today to try and figure out how to repair. However due to the snap in effect, I was not able to repair the problem. This is problematic because I have an event coming up and have to wait for the replacement to be shipped. I even tried to purchase a brand new hose and gun set but the store did not have one to fit this machine. I went to AR North America website, the maker of Blue Clean AR383 power washer and was not able to find my gun or replacement part; therefore, I sent an email, since they are closed on weekends. After finding the part number in the Instructional Manual I checked here at Amazon and there was the gun. However, I think I'm going to take the advice of the Lowes guy, he told me to get rid of the hose and the gun and get one with couplers; otherwise, I may be buying more guns in the future.",

Next, I tried to attach one of the wands - the directions are not clear as to which one give you the most pressure, I found I could not attach very easily and struggled with that. When I realized that it was not the correct wand (this one barely allowed any water to come out-a hose would have done better) I tried to remove it--impossible. The wand would not release! The directions said to push and turn counterclockwise bult it just would not budge. I finally gave up and used a garden hose to do my cleaning.Needles to say, I am not keeping it.",

The leaks were internal. I returned that to Amazon and received a replacement system. The replacement unit seemed OK. The water system did not leak and the unit turned on and worked for a small segment of sidewalk that I tested to see if I was satisfied. This spring I got ready to powerwash my deck, got the oxyclean on and turned on the washer. I got about halfway through and I heard some decrease in the rpm. I turned to see what was going on and there was smoke pouring out of the chassis of the unit. I figured I would keep going, at this point, as there were obviously some big problems ahead. I kept going for another five minutes or so until the motor gave up the ghost. At this point the plastic covering was getting soft from the heat and the unit had a big time electrical smell. It never did trip the breaker. Now the washer is in my garbage can, obviously useless and beyond warranty. Total run time, 2 hours. I am absolutely sure that I did nothing wrong with this washer. The water line was fine, the electrical was fine (GFI outlet) and the unit was on a cement pad away from any spray. Judging from my experience, which I hope you use to guide your decisions, this is a crummy product, and probably dangerous, to boot.",

The wash nozzle works really well for washing cars, bikes, and general wash down work. And the high pressure wand is great for tougher stuff (but nothing too crazy). This is ideal for washing your deck, outdoor furniture, driveway, etc. More stringent jobs may be a little taxing or time consuming with this guy rather than a higher pressure or gasoline powered unit. The bad: The connector from your garden hose to the input is a poorly designed and poorly executed piece. I used mine for roughly an hour before it stopped working entirely, not allowing any water to feed into the washer. A quick trip to the depot fixed it. If you are going to buy this unit, add a good bronze assembly to your cart to fix the problem before it inevitably arises. The trigger lock on the sprayer does not work at all. This is a nice feature to have when you're doing a lot of work in one area. The hose reel is a joke. I didn't even bother trying to wind the hose on to it. More trouble than it is worth. I just wrap everything around the body of the unit.",

I received it within three days and was anxious to try it out. I followed all instructions and attempted to connect the water input connector to my water hose. As soon as I tried to connect the two, I knew it would not connect. The cheap plastic connector male threads were bad. I did NOT strip it. The threads would not connect after I tried on three different water hose. I shipped it back the same day i received.

The 1900 psi is debateable as I can compare the same results as my $99 Craftsman unit thats 10 years old. Hose reel is a good concept although it is so small that the high pressure line kinks at he end fittings because of small drum thus creases and cracks the line. Sorry, this unit just doesn't cut it .... Either go big with a gas power unit or stick witht he $99 units that do the same job.",

So if you enjoy being sprayed and getting your clean windows sprayed., you might like it. The reel to store the pressure hose is of inadequate capacity and very difficult to use. After the first use you will not use the hose reel because it just doesn't work conveniently and you have to fight with it. The location of the pressure hose fitting requires you to unwind the full length of the power cord even if you don't need to for the job at hand. The unit has wheels and a handle, but the unit is so short that you have to walk in a crouched position to move it. This product was so annoying that after three attempted uses (only one of them successful) it went into the trash. I'll never buy another AR product again.",

It cleans off surfaces better than an older, lower pressure washer I used to have, and it stores easily in a compact space. There are, however, a few \"ergonomics\" issues that detract from what could have been a stellar unit. First - re potential leaks: I'm sure that mine doesn't leak because I was able to thoroughly tighten the pressure fitting at the bottom of the front of the unit. The plastic housing of the unit is molded in such a way that the fitting is too close to nearby the housing surfaces. It is EXTREMELY difficult to tighten the fitting, because there isn't enough free space around the fitting to allow your fingers to easily fit around the fitting while tightening it. Very difficult to do. So much so that I only want to do this once. Then, there's the matter of \"tool\" storage - The AC cord wraps around the back of the unit, in back of the mountings for the wands and accessory handle. this means that the accessories have to be removed when storing the cord, or unwrapping the cord. Lastly, the interchangeable wands are quite difficult to attach. When they lock in place, there's no positive feedback that they've been fastened securely. Several times I've had one of the wands simulating a projectile when the pressure was turned on. Fortunately, it only shoots out about 6 feet. I wonder if anyone at the factory/design house ever tried using this unit themselves. It would have been so easy to make a few minor changes which could have made this a perfect unit. All things considered, while I am annoyed at these design aspects(especially because I'm a design engineer), I still like the unit, as it does the job well.",

I waited for that one guy to post his review of his he got at Harbor Freight and he never did. I went on Amazon and bought the #1 rated washer in my price range. I was originally looking to spend about $120 and was going to get a Karcher. They don't stock them at Home Dept. They have one for 99 bucks I believe. I decided to spend a little more based on reviews. The AR383 is great. It is very quiet and I talked to the company. They are in MN and a small office of just 36 people and they pride themselves on great customer service. I bought a Foam Lance from Chemical Guys and it did not fit nor did they have fittings as the AR has special fittings. I returned it as AR sells one as an accessory on their website and it is $59.00 I believe, made in Italy and has brass fittings. It works AWESOME and you dont need a bunch of adapters. In talking to the guys at AR, they told me Karchers unit is tested to 50hours of us. The AR is tested to 100 so it should last twice as long. I talked to detail guys and they told me the Karcher cheap unit is what they used when they started out and they would get 6 months of use washing cars all day long. So I figure the AR should last a while. It is super quiet. On the reviews they talk about a plastic hose connection. I don't understand why people complain. It is actually metal. AR said that people put the adapter on backwards and it would leak and then write a review and they were in error. I find the quality and performance of the 383 to be great for the money. A TON TON TON of foam from their cannon you buy on their website. It has a super long built in cord and I think a 30 ft hose. The sprayer is adjustable so you dont have to mess with different tips. hose is a bit cheap and I bought an extension cord. There is a kink in the hose that wont go away but it only kinks when I bend that specific area. Wish the hose was a bit more flexible and higher quality. The foam cannon and unit are still going stong after a couple of years. i have replaced the plastic garden hose adapter and it wasn't a big deal to order it.",

I've been careful with the plastic hose connector and so far nothing has leaked or broken. Very easy setup and reliable function. Variable wand is nice as is the soap container. The parts are mainly plastic, but I take care of my tools and I think this will last for some time. Not too noisy. For this type of washer, this is an awesome value! If you mainly want to clean concrete, go with gas washer - you will need the power. If you are working with wood this works well and any more power than this machine may damage the wood. Gas machines used with lower pressure valve will probably cut down on the time required, however. Also, if you want to cut your effort by 80%, get the 10 inch flat surface cleaner made to accompany this item.",

I've cleaned my house twice and 3/4 of the pavement around the house twice (crazy previous owners put down almost 2k sq. feet of concrete) and it's worked great. Half of that concrete is under water oaks. They leave green, black and brown scuzz spots. There was also white paint all over the concrete that easily came up with the spinner head. The spinner head will take everything off with enough patience, though it only makes a 2\" strip when you get into paint/lichen. The little black spots the oaks leave are the hardest to get off. The head that makes a line goes a little faster in my opinion but doesn't take paint or the black spots off. Works great on siding for that reason. Yes, mine does leak a little at the body/hose connection but here in the south I'm leaking considerably more than this machine is. It isn't enough to detract from it's rating as I never have to put gas in it, oil in it, listen to it(!) or smell it's exhaust. I drag it out, plug it in, and it works.",

It is so bad, and I have already wasted so much time getting it set up, that I won't waste another minute on this toy packing it up again and shipping it back. One star is one star too much for this piece of junk. I thought I was doing something wrong because the \"pressure\" stream was so thin and so weak. It removed NO dirt on my deck. My garden hose alone has stronger pressure. I tried the various attachments and adjustments, but NO GOOD. I asked my neighbor (a mechanic) to look at it. We both messed around with it and stood there laughing for a long time at this pathetic excuse for a \"pressure\" washer. Maybe it's defective, maybe not. Nothing in the owner's manual to suggest an adjustment to make it work like a \"pressure\" washer. Those of you who had good experiences with this toy are either better at setting it up that I am or have no expectations whatsoever about product quality. I will keep the thing until the Spring and try to give it away to someone who will take it without trying it first. Later Edit: I am editing this review because the problem has been found and solved. We took apart the thing and found a disconnected wire which we reconnected. The motor did not even engage until the wire was reconnected. I must say that the thing now has incredible pressure which is fully adjustable to adapt to any surface. It cleans deeply but, if set properly, does not damage the surface. I used it successfully on synthetic decking, and it did a great job. We should not have had to do our own repairs, but it was worth the effort.",

Also cleaned up years of crud on my sidewalks and cement stairs leading to the basement. Brightened up the cedar fence clean off not only the algae but the gray too; just have to protect the plants/dirt near the fence. Cleaned windows by using it at an angle rather than straight on. Cleaned the crud off the gutters on my garage. Made my plastic plant containers and plastic deck furniture look like new -- I had used every product on the market for the deck furniture and it still was never clean looking until I used this pressure washer. Haven't tried it on my garage floor yet. After reading the reviews I got a metal piece to connect the hose and so it doesn't leak. Having never used a pressure washer, I saw in the directions that the water must be on before you start it so the motor doesn't get damaged. But then if you don't turn on the sprayer, it is quiet and I thought it had stopped working but as soon as I turned on the sprayer, you hear the motor. So it is noisy when you are spraying but not to the point where it should damage your hearing.",

Easy to assemble. Tried it out on my sidewalk first and it did a great job using the turbo nozzle. The next day, I cleaned all the siding on the back of my townhouse, as well as a concrete patio. Watching everything come so clean is addictive, and I find myself looking for anything else I can pressure wash! Works better with a bigger hose - originally used a narrow 1/2\" hose, and when I went around back and used a fatter hose, the pressure was greater due to more water flow. Also, the unit is much quieter than a gas model. Things that could make this unit better: trigger lock to keep it on while cleaning to avoid hand fatigue; longer lances to avoid having to hunch over to clean the sidewalks; accessory storage could be a little better - everything kind of gets in everything else's way, and the lances don't \"snap\" into their holders so they can get knocked out easily. Also, when you let go of the trigger and then pull it again right away, the pump can't catch up so you have to let go for 1 or 2 seconds and then pull it again to get full pressure. These are minor gripes, though. For the money, I am very pleased so far.",

From the beginning, it always leaked at the point of contact, no matter the type of fitting I bought to assist in this matter. I even had my next door neighbor and handy man try and help me. Last time the handy man came, he just flat out told me to buy another one as it had died. This after no more ten times of use. It was just so frustrating that during the time I have had it, I would rather look at a dirty driveway than try and get this pressure cleaner working properly.",

The spray wands are great. They're adjustable and do the job.

When operating, water sprays out sideways in 2 directions (both left & right) out of the gun's lock pin (used to lock the hose to the gun) so I get drenched with water whenever I try to use it now. I always stored this disassembled and took good care of it. The hose appears to be in good condition, so I must assume its the gun. The lock pin itself seems a bit flimsy, so maybe it just loosened up over time so it no longer has a tight seal. I liked the idea of being able to use water more efficiently by using less water than a regular garden hose. This pressure washer already paid for itself with the money I saved washing my own car, instead of paying for car washes. But its a shame this water leak now makes it unusable. I'm debating whether to buy a replacement gun, Blue Clean AR240 and AR383 Spray Gun (AR50968) , as I would expect to have the same problem again in a few years and I'd rather not have to keep buying replacement guns to keep this thing usable.",

Mold and mildew came right off and did not damage stucco. Than I did all my front side walks and driveway. 8 years of dirt had accumulated on both house and sidewalk. This washer took it all off with no detergent. Might use detergent next time on driveway to get off the stubborn stains. Still amazing what it took off without detergent. Also did part of my wood fence that was covered in green mold. It also came right off. Seems plenty powerful for all my needs. Figured it already paid for itself. If I would have hired someone it would have cost more than the $160 I paid, plus I still have the power washer for future needs. No leaking on my unit. It does have plastic couplings but they are working without issue. Be nice if it was brass. As long as it lasts a few years, I am very satisfied.",

The connectors for the hoses are made of metal (brass and aluminum) with standard o-ring seals. This should mean that unlike plastic connectors they should be more durable, and the o-rings can be replaced for cents if needed down the road. The manufacturer makes a big deal that the pump pistons are metal not plastic like others. I am hopeful this will translate into more long-term durability. Maybe others who have owned for a long time could comment. I have used the unit to clean a large composite deck and was very pleased with the performance. The wand is easy to use and having both a long electric cord and a long high pressure hose (ie the hose from the unit to the wand), means that I only moved the unit itself once or twice during the whole operation. The electric plug is protected with a large GFI (ground fault interrupter) which always makes sense when you are around water. I also used the unit to clean the front and back board of a full-height basketball hoop. To do this I was standing on the top of a step ladder and using the wand. The long hose meant this operation was easy. So far I am very pleased with the unit, and I like how both the hose and electric cord have a place to be wound up and stored on the unit, which makes it compact to store away. From my experience so far I am very please with the unit.",

The electrical cord cannot be wrapped around the back holder easily unless you take off the pressure line. The hose winder is a joke as well, you have to unscrew both ends, then feed it just right into the goofy winder. All of the parts are cheap plastic and will break easily. Now the performance: Yes it has great pressure.....IF you need to get one particular bug off your window and have the patience to aim the miniscule jet in the right place. The \"adjustable\" nozzle is simply a deflector, it doesn't actually change the diameter of the spray at all. So it is useless for cleaning decks or any larger surfaces. I even bought the deck brush, this is an even bigger joke and waste of money. I had a competitor washer for four years that was 50% less and did a 100% better job at cleaning. What a waste of money.",

After using the little nozzle cleaner, then a longer piece of wire, the machine would still pulse. I drilled out the nozzle and that fixed the issue, but no longer had high pressure. I purchased a new adjustable wand and right out of the packaging the same issue with the machine pulsing. Now I am live with it and it is so frustrating. Onto the little clear quick connect for the water supply hose. Forget about a good seal ever occurring. After purchasing 2 more and them not sealing, I siliconed a brass hose quick connect to the clear quick connect. That worked for a few months and now the clear quick connects consistantly break.

The dirt should have come right off. I then same day used it to clean a small building. It did a good job on it but of course there wasn't a finish on it to show the dirt like the new car finish shows. The real reson I got the washer is 8 drive a school bus, and part of my job is to clean the outside of the bus 4 times minimum during the 180 days of school. I am not a young woman so scrubbing a car much less a bus is difficult at best for me, so my hopes were dashed when I saw that it basically knocked the worst of the dirt off a glossy finish like my car, my old school bus is still going to be a great deal off work.",

Yes, it leaks slightly around the plastic fitting where the plastic adapter attaches to the machine, but my hose leaks where it attaches to the house so I am quite sure that I could purchase either a washer or a different fitting to eliminate this problem. The good news is that this minor leak does not seem to interfere with the power and efficiency of the unit! It was a snap to assemble, there is a helpful You Tube video tutorial if needed. My 15 year old deck was black with mold and this small,but mighty machine did the trick! I used it for roughly three hours straight and I am very pleased with the results! I plan to give the deck one more spot cleaning to go over some areas that I may have missed.Amazon also had the best price for this particular unit and shipping. I do admit that it was just easier to loop both the power cord and the hose cord around the top handle instead of utilizing the cord wheel to wind it around. I am delighted with the performance of this product!",

Be sure to add rubber washer to fitting before installing on machine. No leaks & all brass. Second: Impossible to use hanger brackets to roll up electrical cord when wand pressure hose is still attached. Fixed by mounting lower bracket near top of handle on back side of machine. Required drilling one screw hole & two holes for locating lugs into hollow handle. Will use machine & add more to review later.",

Having lost faith in the company I decided to remove and wire in a new switch, I was right. The unit run perfectly now, (no thanks to the company) Now that it works I can tell you I do not believe it works as well as the pressure cleaner I already had. It says it is 1900 PSI but it appears to be a lot weaker than my existing 1800 PSI Briggs and Stratton. Features I do like: the pressure hose connections, ( I also purchased the extension hose ) and the 10 inch disc cleaner.

I like the adjustable spray nozzle too. The unit is lightweight and maneuverable even though equipped with high quality internals. On the other hand, the provisions for storing the cord, hose and accessories are pretty awkward. The cord is long (a good thing) but too long to fit on its storage hooks and the hose reel--well don't get me started on that! It's one of those things you wish you could sentence the designer to demonstrate over and over about a hundred times until they promise never to foist such a lame feature on the unsuspecting consumer again! Also the hose is plastic and tends to curl--some other inexpensive washers have metal-lined hoses that are much easier to work with. Overall, a convenient and useful item. Don't leave it out in freezing weather though! Any power washer would be damaged by freezing.",

I called service and ordered the part. They sent the wrong part and when contacted told me they couldn't help. So I read a lot of reviews this time and bought AR Blue Clean 383 from Amazon. It was free shipping and arrived in 3 days. The input connecter sent was not the same one shown on the instructions so it was a little confusing. The upside was that it does not leak as mentioned in several other reviews. It is easy to assemble, light and powerfull. If it keeps working as it does now, it will be a home run.",

I used it over two days to help me clean off 30 years of accumulated crud from the concrete walkway around my house and a patio area. It does a great job and is pretty quiet. It comes with 2 wands, one of which has an adjustable fan spray tip that I found most useful. I haven't really used the conical spray tip that much. If you take your time setting it up (takes about 20 minutes the first time) and follow the instructions, things go pretty smoothly and the machine functions well. The only issue I had was I was afraid to crossthread the couplers for the out tube to the spray wand, and the intake filter for the hose. Take your time on those parts of the setup. Once it is setup it is easy to take down for storage or reassemble without having to look at the instructions. Uses a lot of water so be sure of your drainage, and be prepared for a big water bill. Totally useful and fun machine.",

I received a replacement and the same thing happened. I am not even going to bother to contact them and request a replacement.

I actually really enjoy the lighter weight/footprint but with the Mighty Mouse power. Hose reel, as others have posted, not the greatest. I bundle the hose over the handle and that works well. Hose a slight bit shorter than some other pressure washers but by no means a deal breaker. Note, I purchased the Quick Connect Hose Adapter but one comes with the unit so now I have spares. The in/out ports are brass which for a unit at this price is a pleasant surprise. Actually, this was one of my main buying criteria - purchased a budget type PWasher in the past with plastic inlet and garden hose kept blowing off. For the cost, this little unit rocks and is a very good purchase.",

This was seriously irritating since I had to go searching for a replacement fitting. After striking out at True Value I was able to find a compatible fitting at Home Depot (see photo). Once this was accomplished, I was able to connect the machine to the garden hose and experienced no leaks. The pressure washer itself worked well with no issues other than losing pressure every once in awhile. Overall I am happy so far minus the wrong fitting being delivered with the pressure washer.

I had no leaks where the water was connected. The quick release on our garden hose was even compatible with the unit. I don't have any other experience to compare it's power with but it certainly has plenty of power to clean my log home to prepare it for staining.

It fit and I used the pressure washer for the first time today. It works fine. The only issue I have is the two inserts that fit in the handle of the unit do not fit properly into the storage rack on the back of the unit. They seem to be too large in diameter to fit. If I try and force them in, you can see the plastic straining and looking like it will crack. So, I just don't store them in the place they say to.

If you don't want a heavy gas unit, the problems starting it after a couple years of no use, a lower cost, easy storage and maneuverability, and can live with a power level that does modest jobs then this is a fine purchase.

The handle is too short so I just carry the thing around.In my opinion the wheels should be eliminated, the pressure hose needs to be better quality and the unit should just be a carry around model.The unit operates quite well as far as cleaning goes.

I got the brass fitting in the mail today and will use it next time even though it is not a quick connect. I saw the same connecter a Lowes for less money. The unit worked fine, plenty of pressure. Sometimes if you got the nozzle set to an high pressure stream make it had for the pressure to build up when starting up, so you might have to twist the spray stream a little wider to reduce the back pressure till it gets running fast.

Pros: Inexpensive, good and consistent pressure from any hose, easy to transport, pretty solid Cons: Heavy draw means only heavy duty generators can be used if off grid. Also had some trouble on standard 15 AMP circuits - suppression breaker will not kick over unless it has required amperage on the line. I would recommend a gas powered one for non-grid uses. Rear adapter brackets do not hold the accessories well and the routinely fall off. I just carry them separately.",

My plan was to use this with some TSP to clean my roof in preparation for elastomeric coating this weekend. After getting it all together, again, using the included documentation, I decided to see how it does on my driveway before hauling it up on the roof. Hooked up the hose, turned water on, and gave it power and we were in business...for less than 5 minutes. After about 2 minutes of use I felt a noticeable drop in pressure, so I stopped using it for a minute or so and then gave the trigger another squeeze. Still, lower pressure than I had started with but decent, so I tried to get some paint spots on my driveway off and it worked with ease.. for another 2 minutes. After about 2 minutes of hitting the driveway I started to smell that wonderful smell of burnt electronics. I glance at the unit and smoke is pouring out of the rear vents. I immediately put the wand down and ran to the plug and pressed the reset button (THE UNITS GFCI PLUG DID NOT TRIP WHILE THE UNIT WAS BURNING UP) and then turned the switch on the unit to off. I will post a picture of the smoky unit. Of course, Amazon customer service is second to none and processed my return and refund right away. But I still have to go through the hassle of taking it apart, draining the remaining water, boxing it up, and being available for UPS to pick it up. Oh, and now I'm without a pressure washer for my roof project and will have to visit a big box store and pay more then I would for a [different] unit from Amazon if I still plan to get this done this weekend. Disappointing to say the least. This product has some amazing reviews, so maybe I just had really bad luck. Buyer beware.",

Hose is hard plastic and is difficult to both uncoil into something straight and even more difficult to wind up on the built in reel. I needed two people. The reel is a nice idea but with a hard rubber hose instead of a hose more pliable it is an issue. 3. The hose connection is not directly to the body. It is through two plastic pieces. One threads on to the body of the machine. The other is a friction lock piece. This attaches to the hose and locks to the other piece. The idea was to install a filter which again was a nice idea but does not work well in the context of all the plastic. All these connections occur about 2\" off the ground and the weight of the hose torques everything to the ground. I messed around with this connection for half an hour before I gave up. Yes I did read another reviewers suggestion to buy a brass fitting for this connection and I assume abandon the filter but why should you have to buy something else to get something that you just bought to work? I think AR should review and upgrade the connection and distribution system on this machine. I know it is a competitive market place but one at least expects a product that works well (and works well for a number of years) out of the box. I returned the unit.",

The pump motor ran for about 2 seconds and died. I could not get it restarted. I checked the outlet, power plug reset button and read the trouble shooting guide in the manual. Having tried everything in the guide and being unsuccessful at getting the motor to run I called the customer support line. It was Saturday and I found out the support line is open from 8am through 5pm Monday through Friday, CST. I called back at 8:05am Monday only to find that you do not get to speak with a person but get a recorded message instructing you to leave your name and number and someone will \"return your call shortly\". Would someone at AR North America, assuming they are still in business, please define shortly! Over the next two days I have left 4 phone messages and have received no call backs. Thankfully I bought it from Amazon and was still within the return window. I still need a functioning power washer but it will not be made by AR North America.",

USPS left note in mailbox that it could be picked up the next day at the Post Office. Picked it up and brought it home. Easy to put together and it started up without any problem. Tested soap dispenser and it does use up the soap rapidly. Probably better to apply soap with a sponge. Was using adjustable wand to remove mud from car. Released the handle to move to another area of the car. Electric pump would not come on. Checked the electricity and the circuit was okay. Checked water and it was flowing. Pump would not come on. Followed instructions in manual and called AR Blue Clean. NOT A WORKING NUMBER. Tried to call Amazon. They hide their customer service phone number well. Consequently followed instructions for returning the unit and requested full refund. We'll see how that goes.",

I won't lie in saying this was more of an impulse buy as in I didn't do my research on this purchase. I relied solely on the Amazon reviews that I have learned to trust so dearly. You have let me down! This AR383 uses an arbitrary lance that, from my knowledge, only fits attachments made by AR. There is NO 1/4'' quick disconnect (no universal attachment points at all). I have read on auto detailing forums that it is possible to get the foam cannon to attach but I would have to purchase another unit from AR with a stupid amount of shipping added to it. No thank you! The attachment points on the lance are shaky at best. Also who in the engineering/design department thought it was a good idea to make a hose quick disconnect out of plastic... BRITTLE PLASTIC! So what is providing the water tight seal you say? A poor little O-ring, no wonder so many people claims it leaks. You should have just made the hose attachment a female brass end and be done with it. Another design flaw is the high pressure hose storage. It's more trouble then it is worth. Just coil it up and put it over the handle. Disclaimer: I received this unit today and when I opened it I was appalled. I didn't even have it out of the box for 20 minutes until I printed the return shipping label. I'm probably going to have to eat the $25 return shipping, good riddance to this disposable unit.

The plastic fittings for connections must be precisely tightened and hooked up or they leak. The long electrical and hose cords are great, but easily become tangled during use. The unit is heavy and although on wheele cannot be pulled along like a vacuum, but must be lifted from place to place. That being said, it simply will take me a bit longer to become accustomed to those things, but the washer does its job well. It has good pressure that is easily adjusted with the wands. I hope this brand lasts for many seasons of use as this is a replacement for a Karcher unit that was disappointing.",

I haven't had any issues to call them about, it's just nice to know they are there and are helpful. Where I live we get a lot of mold on everything in the summer. I have washed my house (vinyl siding) and my driveway and sidewalk. There is a \"Turbo-Wand\" that comes with it ( makes the water spin as it comes out) that was great for cleaning some out door chairs that have vinyl tape on the seats and backs. They look brand new ! I also cleaned our bird bath, turned out great. I would guess I have used the washer for 15-20 hours without a hitch. I am 100% satisfied with the performance of the unit. If I compare its' cost with having someone clean my house and sidewalks it has paid for itself. If it had a longer wand attachment with a right angle head I could have more easily reached the highest peak of the house. I haven't checked to see if they offer an attachment like this.",

            "review_text": "Folks: I bought this pressure washer based upon the reviews on Amazon. SEVERAL people indicated that the unit had a leak where the hoses connect and recommended that you buy a \"male to male\" hose connector. Well, when I bought this unit, I purchased the connector and when I received the Pressure washer, I found it was no longer necessary to use the connector because AR North America had fixed the problem and had enclosed a better made connector (made out of clear plastic). I called them and got confirmation that they had fixed the problem and had inclosed a new connector thus eliminating the need to buy an extra \"male to male\" connector. So if you go foward and buy this unit, dont buy the extra connector that reviewers are recommending..It is no longer necessary. PS: Unfortunately AR North America DID NOT UPDATE the instruction manual to include the new pieces...therefore you'll find yourself up a creek when you begin installing this unit. I called them and they straightened me out (and told me that they're getting this type of call alot). When installing this Pressure washer, you will have a clear plastic filter piece which gets plugged into the front of the Pressure washer.Then install the blue piece (which has a black ending) into the other end of the clear plastic piece. Then plug your garden hose into the black ending. This is the order it needs to go in in order for it to work correctly. PLEASE SEE THE PHOTO I POSTED IN THE PHOTO SECTION. IT WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO ATTACH THE PIECES CORRECTLY. (and sorry... I'm not good at giving directions). I have not had the opportunity to try the unit but will do so shortly and will report back asap...but I wanted to give you this review now...so that you dont accidently buy the Male to male hose connector piece that all the reviewers are recommending. It is no longer necessary...wanted to save you the expense. 4/21/2011 I had the opportunity to test this unit and it works like a dream. Definitely no leaks anywhere. I was able to pressure wash my entire pool and patio area with little effort. It is a powerful little machine and definitely gets the job done. I was a little worried about operating a machine which works with electricty and water but I found out after a few minutes that there was no need to worry at all. All cords/lines are well insulated. When I used the unit, the electrical cord did get wet and there were no issues. I wouldnt recommend you go dipping it in a pool but getting the electrical cord wet was not an issue. It worked just fine. I would recommend this unit for residentual use only. At 1900 PSI, its not strong enough to do commerical...just use it for stuff around the house. I would definitely recommend this unit. It is powerful and good for residentual use.",

The dirt is on there so lightly that a finger can wipe it away without pressure. But 1900 psi just isn't enough to take it off. The unit was packaged and functioned beautifully though. If 1900 PSI is what you want, I highly recommend this unit.",

            "review_text": "First, I am amazed at the number of positive reviews this washer received. Upon perusal, of the 315 negative (1-3 stars) reviews, I found many of the same complaints. (No, I did not read all the reviews but just enough to assure my husband and I that we were not alone.) This machine is cheap, flimsy, and cumbersome. The inlet hose connection is on the back. The electric wire and its holder are also on the back making the hose connection difficult. The hose connecter parts are all plastic and easily subject to snap off. Since the online description does not forewarn you, you would not know that they recommend you not use an extension cord. You will see that warning in the manual upon receipt (a bit late). So, with a 20' hose and 30' power cord, you can move barely 50' from your power source. You would need an outlet on all 4 sides of your house. Not seeing that manual entry, we did use a heavy duty construction power cord which my husband uses on his high power tools. The circuit breaker kept shutting off and on repeatedly so we assumed something was wrong with the machine. The outlet hose is on the front. So using this washer is a 2-person job with 1 washing and 1 dragging the inlet/outlet hoses, electric cord and machine. The cleaning fluid bottle holds about 10 ounces so you must stop and fill it about every 3 minutes. The bottle connects to the gun so cleaning fluid sprays your face while spraying the house. My husband could taste it on his lips! He wore goggles to protect his eyes. One spray unit is like using a shower head. The other is like writing in the dirt with your finger tip. Positive: the pressure is good. Only washing 1/4 of our house with extreme difficulty and frustration, we are returning the washer.",

I did get it working once, and it really didn't do a very good job anyway. I tried washing my composite deck and it did nothing to clean it. My regular garden hose will do a better job.

She loves how easily it cleaned the patio... the sidewalk... the bricks around her garden... the stone under our windows... etc.> <Update 1 year later... it is still working just fine. Sometimes I get a bit of spray where the hose screws into the washer, but a quick jiggle and tightening and it always stops.> Our large brick patio was in need of a good washing and removal of the gunk and weeds between the bricks, so I was contemplating the electric SnapOn2000psi from Costco, but none of the stores near us had it in stock, so went on-line and did a ton of research. Settled on this one and am not disappointed at all. It is far, far better than the 1600 psi until I bought at Costco years ago and gave away a year later. The biggest difference is that the hose AND cord on this AR383 easily wind up onto the base so it takes up very little space in our basement and is easy to cart around. My previous one's hose was very stiff and had no location to wind up anything. The AR383s hose is far more flexible than many others. It had plenty of pressure for my needs. Even our brick wall proved to be much dirtier than I realized. It had enough pressure to remove the paint from our wooden gate (oops -- I just needed to back up a bit and all was well.) The hose does NOT need to be removed from the base in order to be wound up (but yes, the handle does need to be removed... the picture is a wee bit deceiving) I had only minor issues with inserting the wand into the handle or turning just the nozzle. It is a small learning curve. I have had no issue with leaks anywhere. There were washers in both side of the hose connection. I had to switch hands every so often due to fatigue, but I did not notice any excessive vibration and a simple sweep back and forth, inching forward one half a brick at a time proved to be effortless. I loved the auto-shut off. Especially when one wants to quickly silence the noise so you can hear your kids. I would have liked to spend $40 less on the SnapOn and have the comfort of easy return, however one cannot buy/use what is not available, so I am quite happy with this purchase. On the box, they show several attachments that are optionally available (a 75 degree angle head, some rotating brushes).",

We used it to clean mold from our driveway, sidewalk, street curb, and all concrete-covered areas [altogether 5 hours of operation]. We also used it to clean mold from the bricks of our house exterior walls [again 5 hours of operation]. The amount of mold was huge: this is the Houston shore area, with atrocious heat and humidity, and the mold had been accumulating for 8 years. The washer worked great! The pressure was sufficient to clean the concrete, although at a pace somewhat slower than for a gas-engine washer. The pressure was just right to clean the house wall bricks [unsealed \"insulation\" bricks, very porous and rather brittle] without damaging them. In fact, the adjustable spray nozzle at focused stream grooved / spalled the brick surface, so we used the turbo-nozzle. Weak points: 1. The recessed water supply inlet and the plastic hose connector [difficult to tighten the connector and to keep the hose from unscrewing itself]. 2. Storage hose reel [rotating drum] diameter is too small, and fast / careless reeling can damage the pressure hose. 3. Winding path for the electrical cable cannot hold it; we extended the cable path to over the washer's handle. However, these are minor issues. [And I notice them because I am an engineer.] Side note: Contrary to what salesmen might tell you, the turbo-nozzle does NOT increase the spray pressure! It lowers the pressure, by extracting energy from the water in order to turn the turbine that moves the spray nozzle [thence \"turbo-nozzle\"]. To get peak pressure, use the adjustable nozzle at focused stream.",

            "review_text": "We listened to most of the reviewers here ordering this washer a week ago and I was hopefully optimistic we'd be spraying away to our hearts content over the Holiday. Sadly the ground fault interrupter plug didn't work on our AR Power Washer, so we couldn't really try it out. Additionally, the quick release coupling joining our hose to the pressure washer is made of the CHEAPEST POSSIBLE PLASTIC. One side is actually threaded for a pipe fitting rather than a hose. It immediately stripped when we tried making it work on the hose. As others have already stated, that problem is solved by going to your local hardware, replacing it with a brass quick connect. For us that was 3 fittings at $5 each. Does anyone else out there think spending $150-$180 on this washer is enough to expect a good quality brass fitting --that actually \"fits\"-- to be included?? Nevertheless, I was preconditioned to buying brass fittings to begin with based on other reviewers. Unfortunately, our problems continued. Apparently the \"ground fault interrupter\" built in to the plug was kaput-- it kept popping its little breaker no matter what we did or where it was plugged in. Based on that we decided it was best to pack it all back up (an arduous & disappointing task) and ship it back to Amazon. Thankfully, Amazon's return policy on merchandise coming from their distribution center is outstanding. Two hours after the fiasco started we dropped our AR Power Washer off at UPS, returning it prepaid by Amazon. Then we migrated on to pick out a replacement at Home Depot. OTHER THOUGHTS: After we purchased and unpacked a Homelite pressure washer replacement from the Depot, I noticed a few more things I pass on for you to for consideration. The AR really feels like a pile of cheap plastic next to a similar Homelite model. -The wheels are plastic (Homelites are rubber), -the frame is plastic (Homelite's is tubular steel), -The fittings are almost all plastic (Homelite's are brass), -the hose is lighter gauge (Homelite's is much better nylon), -The hose reel is useless (Homelite had a functional velcro tie strap) -the spray gun is flimsier than the Homelite as well -The electrical switches and plugs are less sturdy than the Homelite. It was immediately clear to me as soon as we opened the box that the Homelite (at a similar price) was much, much more solidly constructed. Finally, I'd just like to say our new replacement worked out of the box with no monkeying around at the hardware store. So, my advice. Do not buy this model AR Power Washer. And if you're reading this Amazon, I'd start carrying the Homelite (or similar) product line instead of AR if you want to cut back on the returns. I have to say something I rarely do-- the AR is junk. I am NOT saying this Homelite (the Homelite Electric 1700 PSI HyrdoSurge Pressure Washer) is fabulous or anything, I'm just saying in comparison, it is much better constructed. It seems to work fairly well on our deck etc so far, so we're happy.",

If you are not able to supply the parts, make your product so I can purchase the parts locally. I wanted to add quick connectors and wanted metal connectors to replace their plastic connectors. Other than this problem, I think I will be pleased with the pressure washer.",

This is my first review (good or bad) of any product I've ever purchased online, so that goes to show you just how motivated I was to share my bad experience with this product. Unit worked well for about 10 minutes but then began to smell burnt plastic and noticed smoke coming out of the unit. Immediately shut off and didn't use for acouple of days. Then unit would not even turn back on. I can also echo the comments regarding the fitting between the water source and the unit...it's almost comical how much water sprays out of the fitting once you turn the water on. I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone but I guess others have had success based on the positive reviews (which is the very reason I decided to get this product). Hope you have better luck than I did... *** Something else I just noticed and you should definately consider...All of the worst reviews were created in the past six months (March-Sept 2011), and most of the very positive reviews occured before 2011...seems a little strange don't you think????? ***",

And--don't expect pro results on a huge house or driveway. This is a small, electrically powered home unit and for what it's intended, it does well. Try anything big and you'll be disappointed. Good points: Easy enough to use (once you figure out the puzzling instructions.) Good ol' Youtube generally has some show-off giving you a very good tutorial. There are some out there. Does a GREAT job on decks. I washed the algae off our deck railing and it was superior to doing that task with scrub brush and hose. Really got into the crevices of the vinyl railings and took off the green scum. Cleans up boats, cars, small amounts of vinyl siding, sidewalks. If you get that darkened cement from lichens, algae, soot, it will clean it off. Portable, and not too heavy. WAY better than that yellow thing, Karcher. I've never had a Karcher that didn't give up the ghost or fail to do much right out of the gate. This is definitely better. Bad points: Won't do much if you aren't right up close. This is not an industrial powerwasher that the pros use to do your house. It will burn out if you run it longer than (I estimate) fifteen minutes. I warned my borrower, don't run it for long periods of time. It's not designed for that. It heats up. Sure enough, borrower ran it endlessly to clean their sidewalks and it came back (without a word to the wise) dead, dead dead. Yeah, I know what you did there. Moral of story, neither a borrower or lender (of your favorite or expensive tools) be. Bottom line: will do smaller tasks with great ability, but can burn out if you get over-enthusiastic and it won't do a 2 story house or a 100 foot yacht. For that, you have \"people.\"",

I chose this particular model because of the long power cord and the long high pressure hose. As extra bonuses you also get 1900 pounds of pressure and everything wraps up nice and neat on the unit. My only concern is the plastic connection for the hose. I wish they would have used brass or steel like what they have on the high pressure connection. I've tested the unit for about three hours. I washed a couple of windows; did a great job. I cleaned my tiled patio; got the dirt out of the grout. I cleaned my car; got most of the dirt, but even a 3000 psi unit can't get it all, it's just a basic fact you have to use some elbow grease to get road scum off. I also tried it on my fence to clean off dirt and moss build up; didn't do such a good job but then again it is a 1900psi unit and for wood you really need at least 2600psi. For that you need a gas unit and I really don't want to deal with the mess, the loud noise, and the maintenance. I'm really happy with this unit so far, I just hope it doesn't break after a couple of uses like I heard from reviewers of other brands.",

I do have a sense that a gas powered, larger machine might do in one pass what I have to do with two passes on this one. However, the fact that it is so small, light, gas/oil free and easy to stow is a huge advantage over a gas powered one. I would not trade it for a gas one. So after cleaning the deck, proceeded to stain with a Wagner Power Sprayer and Behr stain. Went really well and discovered that the power washer makes cleaning up afterwards so much easier.
