            "review_text": "Purchased Anker product to replace old computer speakers connected to Dell laptop as well as to eliminate the need for headphones or earbuds on tablet with anemic speaker. Speaker would show as connected to laptop, sounded fine (albeit a tad bass-y), but was in perpetual blink mode. When listening to talk radio stream or spoken audio files (such as guided meditations or yoga routines), the audio clipped. While online, moving between tabs caused the audio to stutter. Couldn't get the speaker to pair with tablet or for it to be recognized using audio cable (Panasonic headphones and Sony earbuds connect with no issues). Anker provided a replacement but speaker continues to blink when used with laptop unless added/removed with each use which shouldn't be necessary. Was able to get replacement speaker paired with tablet but still unable to get it to work on tablet when connected using audio cable. The speaker crackles, the headphone icon appears for a second and then nothing. Surprised to be given the 'low battery' warning after having used speaker in actual BT mode for barely a handful of hours. Perhaps all the connection and pairing attempts took their toll. Fortunately, it recharged rather quickly. Speaker is insanely too loud. Been blasted more than a few times, when connecting, so have to remember to take volume setting down to zero and then tweak to about 5-8% which is sufficiently loud if within several feet. At 15-20% my entire apt bldg would be given an earful. After too many hours spent troubleshooting, I'm done trying to figure out why I'm not enjoying this product in the same way those of the 'glowing reviews' are. Bottom line: will use the Anker speaker via BT with tablet and with audio cable with laptop. Finally, have a much-loved laptop remote which allows for adjusting volume from some distance (great for when doing workout videos). Unfortunately, trying to use it in combination with the Anker speaker, when connected via BT, cancelled out the BT. (Not particularly tech savvy but can appreciate how this might happen.) So, in some respects, using the speaker with the cable on the laptop still affords the ability to adjust the volume from across the room versus having to be within arm's reach of the keyboard as required by the Anker speaker.",

Amazingly loud for such a little speaker. Pairs easily. I like the grippy surface on the bottom of it - makes it easy to sit on my dash and doesn't move at all. This would slip easily into a jacket pocket - and maybe into some baggy pants. Just incredibly handy if you are out and about and have a desire to listen to something on your phone, especially if you're sharing it with someone else. Controls are dead simple - just push the \"on\" button.",

It will stay with the red light (charging) for hours and never come out of it. I tried several chargers, but nothing brings the speaker back to life. I'm sad because this is the first Anker product that fails me (I have Anker portable batteries, solar chargers, etc.). Update: After posting my review, I was contacted by Anker support. They sent me a replacement speaker. I wanted to wait for some time before claiming victory. After a few months, the new speaker is still working, so I've updated my review from 1-start to 4-stars, as Anker stands behind their products.",

            "review_text": "Bought this item on the strength of the Anker name (love their power banks and charging cables) and a little bit of spec sheet comparison. I was looking at units 4 times as large that put out 4 watts and 6-8 hours of bluetoothand found out this mighty mite put out 3 watts and 12 hours of bluetooth and it's small enough to forget that you have it in your jacket pocket or bag. It really is the size and shape of a ring box. Got it out and put it on the charger. Red led in power button says it's charging. Red flashing means low battery. Red light goes off when fully charged. Pairing with nfc is super easy. Push and hold power button for three seconds and light in power button starts flashing blue. Touch my Samsung s5 active to anker logo on top and phone asks if I want to pair it. Click yes and it's done. Now the part everyone wants to know about, how loud and how good does it sound? First It is NOT a thumping bass monster. It is not realistic to expect that from a speaker 1 1/4\" in diameter (approx). It does however fill a good sized living room 15 x 18' approximately with nice clear sound. It has stronger mid and highs but all in all it has little distortion and let me repeat it is a TINY little speaker. For its size and weight it sounds phenomenal. Appearance and construction. Design is clean and elegant. Small vent holes around bottom help balance air flow and sound of speaker. It has its main speaker grill on top with a tasteful grey anker logo justified left center. The front has a small combination power button and indicator light just below the center of the front panel. The back has a female micro - usb port in the mirror of the power button position. It operates as both a charging port and with the included adapter cable an input from your 3.5mm stereo output to the speaker if your device does not have bluetooth. The bottom of the speaker has full coverage rubber to keep it from moving around on its own. I also suspect it hides the fasteners that hold the speaker together because no fasteners are evident anywhere on the speaker. I just don't want to peel it loose to see. I haven't tested battery life, but past experience with Anker products gives me confidence that it will be in the ballpark of the 12 hours they promise. I found only one SERIOUS down side to this little speaker. While a guy can forget he has this in his pocket, the females of the species are trained from birth to notice objects of this particular size and shape. They can become highly emotional and upset when they find it is not a new toy for them from Tiffany, DeBeers, or Zale's but is instead a new tech toy for you. For some reason they act as if it was an intentional act of provocation. Seriously though this speaker is a worth while choice for anyone looking for a speaker that is truly tiny but packs a good deal of punch. I'm giving it 5 stars because even though it lacks bass and stereo sound when judged for what it is...it is simply astounding. Good job Anker. You knocked this one out of the park.",

Its very small ~ a tiny 1.6\" x 1.6\" inch cube, it will fit in the palm of your hand, your pocket, purse or briefcase; but the sound is REALLY BIG. I was amazed by the quality, clarity and depth of the sound. I was so ecstatic, I went back and purchased 3 more. The price was a fraction of what I paid for a much larger, name brand, wireless speaker last year; the sound on the Anker Ultra Portable Pocket size speaker is far better. Spent less but got so much more. It pairs perfectly with my Amazon Echo Dot and the music is phenomenal.",

Unlike those other reviewers, I was shocked that an audio product with such high reviews could sound so unlistenably bad. Sure, it's no bigger than a piece of sushi, but if it can't even sound better than the cell phone it's paired to (it doesn't) why does it even exist? Volume is pretty loud, but the sound is so piercing and so shrill you'd never want to have it turned up all the way. I returned the Anker because in addition to the terrible sound, it had trouble staying paired to devices. Instead, I ended up with JBL Micro Wireless Ultra-Portable Speaker with Wireless Bluetooth Connectivity (White) , and am very happy I sacrificed a few valuable square centimeters of packing space for vastly better sound. The whole JBL Micro / Clip line sounds worlds better than the Anker -- and they might even be lighter, despite being slightly larger. It's neat that Anker made a speaker this small. But it turns out they shouldn't have.",

            "review_text": "I looked at the speaker both on the Anker site and the Amazon site. I bought it from Amazon because I'm a Prime member so I got free shipping as opposed to several bucks on Anker. I realize that it's a small speaker. But, when I opened the box and took out the speaker, I couldn't believe it. It's just a tiny bit larger than those wooden alphabet blocks that children play with. I turned on the speaker and it immediately paired with my iPhone 6. It came with almost a full charge so it was ready to play right out of the box. But I plugged in the charger for about an hour and now it's fully charged. It comes with a USB to Micro USB charging cable. It also has a Micro USB to audio plug so you can plug it in to a non-Bluetooth radio or whatever music source you want to use. Finally, it comes with a soft cloth bag so you can safely throw it in your backpack or briefcase or purse without having to worry about scratches and dings. I picked out a Bruce Springsteen concert from August 23, 2016 to try out the speaker. I also have the Anker SoundCore speaker and I couldn't tell any difference in the sound. It really is a great ultra portable speaker that you can easily carry anywhere and play music from your smartphone. With the twelve hour battery life before the next charge, you can use it just about the entire day with no problem. This speaker gets my highest recommendation.",

            "review_text": "Where to begin? This little speaker is absolutely exceptional and right out of the box it will blow your mind! Personally I have never been so satisfied with something I have bought as I have been with this speaker. First the packaging itself is very appealing and ensure that the item is safe, furthermore the setup alone can literally be done in seconds when pairing to a phone via Bluetooth or NFC. Both Android and Apple devices pick up the speaker almost immediately and before you know it they are paired. The build quality of the device is also brilliant, soft to the touch yet very durable and offers such an simplistic look which results in a rather unique and elegant look. The sound further adds to the uniqueness of this device as hands down it is one of the best in its class and to be honest could easily compare with other bigger devices. The sound is crisp and clear as well as offering a very well balanced sound with decent bass which will easily tantalize your ear buds in wanting to listen more and more. Even from a distance the sound is still exceptionally clear and while testing the range in an office building with lots of interference be it WIFI, Walls, AC\u2019s and various other signal forms and moving from one end to the other, the device never lost signal and sound was as clear as ever. Overall this little speaker is well worth the price tag and will meet your expectations and then some more. I showed it to a friend who within a few minutes of looking at it and hearing it, immediately went online and bought one. PROS: Affordability Portability Sound Quality Build Quality Battery Duration Enjoyment & Excitability Showoffability (If that\u2019s even a word) \u2013 Trust everyone who sees this little speaker is blown away CONS: I\u2019m sure there are other people who have CONS when it comes to this speaker but to be honest, for what it is it\u2019s perfect. My only thing I don\u2019t like is that it\u2019s a Finger print magnet but alas it can be cleaned so it\u2019s not such a big issue. If you are looking for a simple yet very effective portable speaker.....Look no further as this is all you need!!!!",

Somehow I ended up with 2 of these, and was charged for both of them. I don't care for them. I ordered this one and the larger 7908 model to see which one I liked the best. I like the 7908 better. It does have a volume control on it, and sounds a lot better, but it doesn't go very loud either. As long as the original recording is at a decent volume, it's great, but if not, not so great. I wish I could return these 2 small speakers and get 1 more of the 7908 speakers.",

It really has incredible sound for its size. The highs sound very clear. But as expected, there is not that much bass. But that\u2019s not surprising given its very compact size. I mount it on my bike for portable listening and it sounds clear and very loud. In addition to being very portable, the speaker is very durable. I have dropped it multiple times and it still works perfectly, only receiving some minor scuffs on the outside. On top of all of this, the battery life is very good. It last a long time on full volume. It also charges very quick if you make sure to use a high quality charging cable. I recommend this speaker to anyone who wants an extremely portable speaker. If you want to sacrifice portability for sound, there is many speakers by Anker that aren\u2019t that much more expensive.",

After posting my not-so-glowing review, I was contacted by the company and they offered me a full refund. This goes a LONG WAY toward my positive feelings about Anker. I wish them all the best in future product development. And this was an unsolicited \"Thank You\", from me. ****************************************************************************************************************************************** \"Hi. My name is Pie Grrrl and I'm a Bluetooth-A-Holic.\" There, I admitted it. I must own over 20 different types of Bluetooth speakers: from very large non-portable ones, to large Bose portable, to light-bulbs with speakers and a plethora of small, hand-sized ones. Some I've gotten through Vine to review but the majority I've just purchased outright. \"Why???\", you have the right to ask, \"WHY so many darn Bluetooth speakers?\" Simple, I'm of the ancient age where the Magical Mystery of having two unconnected devices create SOUND...glorious SOUND...in my presence still amazes me and leaves me awestruck! I'm from that Ancient Age of Mankind where you hauled your RECORD PLAYER outside with a lonnnng extension cord from the garage, in order to listen to tunes from your 45 rpm and 78 rpm record collection. So, the fact that a playing-card sized smart phone can transmit music to a ring-box sized speaker just gob-smacks me and will continue to do so for the remainder of my life. I travel extensively for my work so the smaller something is and the less weight it is, it becomes a Bonus for my aching back and the Drag It Around Factor at the end of a grueling day of landscaping. I already have 2-3 preferred small speakers (size of a Twinkie) that I use daily, but when I saw the photos for this speaker and read/watched the videos of it's performance, well....I was \"One-Click\" away from yet another Bluetooth speaker. It arrived in record time, well wrapped in a bubble-wrapped paper mailing envelope. The exceedingly sturdy cardboard box came with a slip-off cover. The wee speaker was inside of the box with the pictured cables and a guide to set up. After a couple of days of use, here's my impressions: 1) Not my favourite small speaker but it gets points for how LOUD it really will broadcast sound. It beats the pants off of ALL of my other tiny Bluetooth speakers with the ability to blast out sound. However, since I NEVER listen to music that loud when I'm by myself, the need for that volume is lost on me. I have much better speakers for parties when I need large quality sound. 2) Compared to my other speakers, this is bare bones, no frills of any kind technology. I have small speakers that \"speak\", saying they are \"Now Connected\" and \"Goodbye\" when you disconnect. I have small speakers that have tiny carry bags; this came with NOTHING. I have tiny speakers that either have a lanyard or a carabiner clip so that you can keep track of them: this has NOTHING! 3) Indicator light: ALL of my other speakers have at least some sophistication in the light department: they either have a very complicated and well-thought out light system indicating the degree of charging or a different blinking system whilst charging. This speaker has the World's Smallest RED light indicating it's charging and a chronic flashing blue-light whilst playing....WHY???? To me, the constant 4-times-per-second blinking light simply drains the battery: if you can't tell that you speaker is playing music while listening to it, the microscopic blinking light ain't gonna help. 4) Sound quality: yes, I realize it's 'wee' but it's almost too heavy on the treble and non-existent on the lower tones. I've set it on a hard surface where it was un-listenable and a soft surface (mouse-pad) where it dampened down the high notes and made it more pleasant. Bottom line: I own better speakers and for about the same amount of money. Yes, it's as Cute As The Dickens, for being so teeny-tiny and I gave it major props for that, but the fact that it came with NO carry case, no lanyard and is behind the times in built-in notifications, I'm giving it 3 stars. Wish I could do 3.5 but amazon doesn't allow it.",

Personally I prefer the Ultra Portable one. It works out because my brother like this nano better so I gave it to him. The nano and ultra both have similar sounds. I think the other one sounded a little better. I liked the color options of the ultra better. The nano is a little smaller. The surface area of a face is a little bigger however it is flatter. I would say that the nano takes up less space. Both are great products however. So basically the nano has newer bluetooth, microphone for phone calls and it is flatter taking up less physical area. The ultra has Better colors, longer battery life, and has a smaller surface area but is a bit longer. Can't go wrong with either one. just colors and battery life gave be the edge over the newer bluetooth and microphone.",

From the picture, I was expecting something like a 4\" cube. When it arrived in a little box, I thought I should have read the product description more closely; it clearly says it's a 1.8 inch cube. I was prepared for a tinny, disappointing little sound. After easily connecting it via Bluetooth, it went on and I was amazed. Shocked really. The sound is as good as speakers many, many times it's miniature size. Not sure how they did it, but Anker deserves enormous credit for this achievement. Full, rich tones. I now have the speaker across the room hidden behind a small plate; the sound is filling my entire room. I can't recommend this product enough.",

I jerry-rigged a keychain holder to put this around my neck and I love it. The speaker really is small. I swear you could hide it inside a coke can without a problem. It comes with a micro-USB charging cable and a 3.5 mic to micro-USB cable to connect to non-bluetooth devices. It also comes with a pouch to carry it all. I was not expecting much from such a little speaker but the sound is very good. It is a far cry from something like Bose but it is definitely better than stock phone or computer speakers. It only has one button to power it on/off and for pairing. Volume is controlled using the volume on your phone, computer, tablet or other device. I found that the best place to listen to it was by placing it close to you by your desk so it is almost under your head or laying down so that the speaker is facing you. I used an equalizer to tune the sound more to my taste by you have to understand this is a single speaker so you will not get real stereo sound from it. Continuous playing at mid volume provides approx 5-6 hours of playing time. It does not have a mic so you cannot use it for phone calls. This is strictly a speaker. For what it is, this little guy does a good job. I am not wowed by it but it does the job I got it for well. If you want more sound you will have to spend more money but if you want something much better than your device's stock speakers more oomph to the music you can't go wrong with this.",

Battery lasted from dawn to dusk without any effect and went on again the next day...well over 14 hrs total. It is totally portable and about the size of a ring box (as described). I call it my \"pocket Ompah Band.\" Note: Bought this on recommendation from a friend that has the larger model. I went for this smaller model for size. It is actually as loud as the larger model and runs just as long (side by side test)...for LESS MONEY and in a smaller form factor. Anker really got this right.

It's not going to blow you away or anything, and it's definitely lacking some fullness, but if all you're looking for is a small step up from your laptop or phone offering without being too cumbersome, this is probably your best option. It fits in any normal-sized pocket. I got this as a gift, and the recipient only uses it through Bluetooth, so I can't speak for the NFC quality. But through Bluetooth, these start to crackle around 75%. They sound pretty good up to then, but regardless of the track, device, or track source, these will max out pretty easily. I would've liked if anker had done a little better on controlling this. Even at 75% though, these are pretty loud and adequate for any light to medium ambient noise. Even though the speaker only faces one direction, as long as it isn't facing a surface it's got great clarity and volume. Next to speakers up to 3 times its size, it can get just as loud (although rarely as full or bassy of course). The buttons are clicky, good quality, and easy to use.",

I charge using an Anker cord and the cord is so stiff and the speaker is so light that even brushing the cord can knock it off the desk. Also, I know it's supposed to be all about simplicity but not having any kind of volume controls can be irritating, especially when that means I have to completely open and wake back up my laptop at night to do so. I do think this speaker is worth purchasing though. Some of those complaints are probably just me specific and they don't outweigh the reasonable price, good sound quality, or ease of use.

Overall seems a little boosted in the mid-range which is something to consider. For listening to podcasts or talk radio, it's absolutely perfect though, because vocals will come through loud and fill up a room. For most music it will do a good job too, because thankfully and most importantly for a (inexpensive) little speaker, it's real loud. Functionality I give a 4/5. The one problem with the design is that unless you're connected via Bluetooth, you simply cannot use it while it's charging. Most portable speakers will charge and play audio through a split cable, or use two separate inputs. This speaker comes with one USB port and two separate cables. I usually keep a portable USB battery charging pack on me. Ideally I could keep the speaker on and re-charging while still listening, but that's not the case here. The (Sansa Clip) MP3 player I use only has a headphone output- no Bluetooth, and many people are in the same boat. Other than that issue, I do recommend this speaker because it seems built to last, unlike most others in it's class.",

(I don't actually know that this theory actually works but it makes sense to me that if I make noise, animals are more likely to hear me coming and keep their distance.) We had the larger version of this speaker and I didn't care for it. For one, it was too big for my purposes. For another, the plug to attach to my ishuffle kept getting loose from the speaker outlet so I was constantly fidgeting with it. (I would've returned it had i realized the problem before the the return date expired.) I haven't had any problems with the outlet on this mini-version. And the speaker is so lightweight and small (smaller than a tennis ball), that it is very convenient to carry. I keep it in the included pouch and just tie it to my utility belt since I hate carrying things in my pockets. I never even have to take it out of the pouch because I can access the on/off button right through the fabric. For my purposes, the sound is just fine and it has plenty of volume for even outdoor listening. I also love that it tells you when the battery is getting is low and makes a sound when you turn it off so you know it's off. Totally recommend if you want something with a small footprint.",

I read all the reviews and decided to try this one. I am truly amazed! I wasn't expecting much in the way of sound quality in something this small, but I am very pleased with the sound. I was also happy that it arrived charged up and ready to use. I've listened to it for a couple of hours now and forced myself to pack it away. The reviews say it fully charges in less than a couple of hours but I don't want to arrive at my vacation destination and have to immediately charge it up. My only negative comment is that evidently there is no way to know how much battery us left until the speaker announces 'low battery'. But then again, maybe there's a way that I just don't know yet. At any rate, this little speaker seems to be perfect in every way so far, and oh, by the way, you can't beat the price either!

I'm sure you're tired of hearing this, but you really just have to hold it in your hand to appreciate its size. - Sound quality and volume. Regardless of its size, the sound quality is great. I'm not an audiophile so I can't speak technically, but I played a few unique songs and they sounded mostly great. Now, if you consider its size, the sound quality and volume are AMAZING. The power this little speaker has will blow you away. And it doesn't sound too bad at high volume either. - Battery life. I'm not sure how true it holds to the \"12hr\" battery life, but I can definitely say it lasts for a long time - Looks. It just looks great. My laptop is also fully black and my mouse is black so everything looks great together. - Durable. I've dropped this thing onto some hard surfaces and everything works as it did on day 1. Now onto the cons. There are two but they are kind of related - I'm not sure what to call this \"feature\", but it sort of turns off and on during songs. It's hard to explain, but if there is a quiet spot for more than 2 seconds in a song it will sort of power off. I don't believe this is an issue with mine because I've went through 3 of these and they have the same issue. Now 70% this isn't an issue, but sometimes with songs that have a lot of fade-in fade-out, words can get cut off and it's extremely annoying when it happens. I'm assuming this feature saves battery - Buzzing/humming/coil-whine. Again, I've went through 3 of these, and unless all 3 were bad, this is definitely an issue. And it's only an issue through bluetooth. Most people won't hear this or even care. But for me it's slightly annoying. When listening to anything quiet or at moderate volume, you will hear a very very faint whistle. It's not annoying loud and barely noticeable, but that's exactly why it bothers me! I can barely hear it but ITS THERE. To most people this won't even be an issue, but I just really wish the speaker didn't have this faint whistle noise. As you could tell, I'm really picky. I did a lot of reading on reviews and settled on this product, and I am very happy with my purchase. I wish it didn't have the two issues I mentioned above (sound fading/whistling), but other than that, the speaker is phenomenal. The sound quality, battery, volume, size, looks, will impress you.

You cant pair it to more than one device which is a bummer, it has to be first unpaired, then repaired to the new device... which is kind of annoying, but after searching multiple products, this seems to be the norm, so if your going to be sharing this thing you have to keep that in mind. The range is great as well. The speaker gets pretty loud, your not going to be entertaining guests or anything... but for its size its nice. As others have stated, you do lose some audio quality when you crank up the volume, but its not meant to rock the house, its a tiny speaker, if you want better sound quality get the slightly larger version. Also worth noting that the build quality is decent... doesn't feel light, or cheap like those small speakers which I have broken before. Made of a hard polymer or resin, outside feels like rubber or silicon... its rather nice. Volume is controlled by the phone, there is no volume control on the speaker, or any controls for that matter, its a very simple yet well built speaker. It also comes with a nice little pouch that I didn't expect to get. Pros - Very Portable, good build quality, pairs easily, good sound quality when used at a moderate volume, good battery life, quick charging speed, good range. carrying pouch included. Cons - can only pair to one device at a time, audio quality loss at highest volume, no speaker controls, All in all, its a nice little speaker.

Nothing else to say. I mean, how much better could it be :-). Highly recommended. As an aside, I have purchased several Anker products including battery chargers, and a bluetooth keyboard and more. I have never been anything but 100% pleased with any of them. Check my other reviews. Also, please reread the disclaimer at the top of this review. It IS true!",

I wanted to use it for my laptop so it would be louder when I was watching anime or YouTube videos. It comes with an aux cord but it's different than a standard aux so if you ever lost it you'd have to more than likely go online and order one which was my only complaint. But if you take care of your speaker and don't loose the cord it shouldn't be a problem. It comes with a little cloth bag to put your cords and speaker in which was waaay cool. I did notice the packaging was super simple and easy to open and I could start using my speaker right away! I definitely recommend this if you are on edge of getting this like Nike says....JUST DO IT..lol all jokes aside it's a great speaker I think you would enjoy and I personally would love to try more products from this company in the future",

            "review_text": "What comes in the box: - The speaker (measuring just over 1.75 inches) - The Micro USB charging cable - The Micro USB to 3.55mm auxiliary cable - User guide - Carrying bag Anker products are now coming in no hassle packaging. The speaker is boxed in a simple, easy to open cardboard box and there is no cellophane or plastic packaging to deal with. Upon opening, you will find the speaker nested in the box and a smaller box containing the power cord, the auxiliary cable and the carrying bag and the user guide. The speaker comes pre-charged and holds a charge for an ample 12 hours, as advertised. Charging the unit is quick and in my tests, is fully charged in about three hours. Charging is denoted by a red light on the power button and turns off when the speaker is fully charged. When you turn the speaker on, it automatically goes into pair mode to search for a device to pair to or the most recent device that it has connected to. Additionally, the speaker has great sound, and a surprising amount of bass, considering its size. Because of its design, there is no integrated volume control so adjusting the volume of what is being played must be done through the device. The NFC connection works flawlessly and I was able to pair my HTC One M8 easily without a hitch. I was also able to pair older phones easily through the standard pairing function of the devices as well as a couple Bluetooth transmitters that I own for my non Bluetooth Devices. When the speaker is paired with a device, there is an audible \u2018beep\u2019 played through the speaker and the power indicator light is a solid blue. While searching for a paired device, the light blinks rapidly and when pairing with a device, the light blinks slower. Because of the design of the unit, you cannot use the provided auxiliary cable while charging (as there is only one Micro USB port on the speaker but charging while connected via Bluetooth has no issues on playback. There is no microphone on this unit so using it as a speakerphone is not really practical. I think that the Anker A7910 is a great little speaker and is something that I would consider buying again as a gift.",

Like all the Anker products I have, it seems well designed and is packaged well (similar to Apple products). It paired easily with several different iPhones and the Bluetooth connection was easy to set up. The package comes with a USB cable, but no wall AC adapter. It also comes with a miniplug to USB cable in case you want to hardwire a connection instead of using Bluetooth (a nice touch). The sound is pretty good, although it is significantly lacking bass compared with other Bluetooth speakers I have and have experienced. It also does not have a mic on it, as some models have, and is lacking a volume control on the unit itself (i.e., you control volume on the source device and not on the speaker itself). All things considered, I would buy it again, mainly because of it's small size and good battery life.",

But for a twenty dollar bill, this is WAY better than most bluetooth speakers you can find in your local stores, and all of those local speakers cost at least twice as much. And the ones that only cost $20 like this Nano, sound like crap compared to this. Buy this for your kids. Better yet, buy them that Anker SoundCore Nano for the same price. I love Anker products. I have MANY of them. All of them I bought them with my own money. NOTHING was given to me.",

I bought this Anker speaker about 4 months ago and have been using it almost everyday since! First off I will say, I am a huge backer and buyer of Anker products, they have really nice products from Solar Panel Chargers to Bluetooth Speakers and everything in between, these guys can hook it up (not a paid review, just a big fan). Also they have some of the best customer service I have ever dealt with! Back to my review, I will say this is my most favorite bluetooth speaker I have owned (out of 4). The speaker is very small, lighweight, easy to use, has a 12 hour battery life, 18-month warranty and not to mention somewhat Waterproof! The only reason I say somewhat waterproof is because I took this speaker with me Canoeing, long story short our Canoe flipped and all of my stuff was either lost or completely drenched, the speaker being one that was completely drenched. Now at first the speaker wouldn't work (power on) at all but after leaving it in my car for 3 hours after it had gotten drenched, it managed to dry out, power on and play music again, without any distortion! Now for $20 I am more than happy to have bought this Anker Bluetooth Speaker, it's done more than I bargained for and has made me and others happy with the sound it lets off for such a small speaker! Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and definitely recommend this to anyone in the market to buy one, it would make a great \"small\" gift! Thanks!",

While I liked the size, battery life, and how loud this speaker can be, it had a very high-pitched whining noise that was prevalent whenever sound was coming out of the speakers. I thought it was not a defect but a product flaw due to a review on amazon that stated that he has gotten an replacement and the problem was prevalent so I ignored it as a flaw in the model in general, not my specific speaker. Few days later, I received an email from Anker asking me whether I was satisfied with the product. I asked when whether the whining sound was a problem with the model or my speaker. They said it was my speaker. Since they paid for return shipping I decided to just try getting a replacement, despite that review. After I got my replacement, it was perfect. No more high-pitched noise. Product has nice matte texture and a rubber non-slip base. While it's a shame that it cannot be charged and play through a 3.5mm aux cable at the same time, I think wireless playback still works while charging. It's half the size of my fist and yet can match normal desktop speakers in volume. The battery life is great. I've used it for a full day as my desktop speakers and did not have to charge it. I'm not an audiophile so I cannot comment on sound quality, but it's very crisp. No distortions or whatsoever even with a wireless bluetooth connection over ~4 feet.",

I was immediately struck by its design and quality. It's solid, with excellent fit and finish - it feels \"right\", the product of putting quality before profits. And, really, what I like most is just the unlikeliness of its existence; a cube, each side about as wide as three and a half sugar cubes, and yet it's so much more than a toy.

From its packaging to the product itself. For $23 your really getting a quality product. The materials this little speaker is made from feel and look great. The whole bottom of the speaker is rubber so it won't slide around while in use. As for the sound quality, when you first get it you'll be expecting a decent performing little speaker. Something that sounds a little better then the built in speaker on your smartphone. However once you pair it with your phone you will be impressed with it. It sounds much bigger then it is. The sound is clear and well balanced. It reproduces highs and mids very well. However it does have a little trouble with lows and bass. But that's to be expected. You can certainly hear the lower freqencys but its obviously not going to be like a stand alone sub. But again for a speaker this small it produces very acceptable levels of bass and low frequencys. If I had to compare the sound quality of this device I'd say its similar to that of a mid level portable sterio or small boom box. The battery life is very good. Its able to get through an 8 hour work day with plenty of charge left. Inusualy leave mine at 75% volume. This speaker is loud enough to play in a busy shop. Its also loud enough to fill a large room! Its obviously not a good choice for playing over a croud but a small get together shouldn't be an issue. I'm going to leave this speaker at work since it easily fits in my draw. I also ordered the larger version to keep at home. I think I might have found my new favorite Bluetooth speaker company! Usually small speakers like this, at this price point are cheaply made and have only decent sound. But this thing blew me away in every aspect. I'm looking forward to recieveing the bigger version soon. I should also add that the device you pair it with will have an effect on the sound quality you get. For example my LG G3 is able to play this speaker at loud levels but I feel as if my phone can't let this speaker acheave its full capabilities. My Lenovo PAD S8-50 on the other hand really brings out the full potential of this product. So I guess the sound quality of this speaker is affected by the product you pair it with.",

If you pair it with a phone, put the phone in your pocket, and then walk around the room, depending on obstructions between the cube and your phone, the connection becomes inconsistent. But within line of sight, the connection is good for about 10-15 meters (depending on the device). I am probably going to buy one for myself.

Of course, since it has a passive sub-woofer, you're not going to get amazing sounding bass, but it's there. If you listen to music that isn't reliant on a strong bass presence, I think you will enjoy this speaker. For the people who can't listen to songs without bass, I played Stevie Wonder's Superstition and it sounded great. (I had to lower the quality of the video to fit 100MB... Also, as I was making the video, I realized I don't have that many songs that are \"bass-heavy\" haha..) - I had trouble uploading the video to Amazon (come on, seriously??) so I uploaded onto YouTube instead - http://youtu.be/IB8XQ1mSh28 It's extremely easy to carry around. You can put it in the provided cloth pouch (which is pretty nice), along with the two included cables (microUSB charging and microUSB-AUX) in the same pouch, and carry it around in the size of a men's cargo pants side-leg pocket. Of course, it would be even easier for women to carry around in a purse too. All of that said, for something at this size and for this quality, you can't go around with ~$22-25. You're not spending over $60, so you wouldn't be disappointed by the sound it puts out for the cost. Rather, you would be happy that spending less than $25, you're getting a Bluetooth/AUX/NFC super-portable speaker that puts out sound quality that could equal or best some more costly ones! I am giving it 5 stars, not because it is the best speaker out there, but because the cost is low and the quality is high. Granted, I haven't had it for more than a month yet, but it feels solidly built. I'll have to update once it passes a few months!",

It's inexpensive, so I wouldn't be upset if it was lost or stolen. It's small, and can be tossed in the glovebox when not in use. It's surprisingly loud, more than adequate for the car on a noisy highway, and the audio quality is very clear for dialogs. I don't use it for music but it would be sufficient for casual use. The device itself has a very nice, solid finish, and comes with charging cords, audio jack and felt bag for storage. The battery lasts quite a long time and charging is quick.

The products is able to connect with my devices with bluetooth and the chord connection. The only problem I find is when I tried connecting the bluetooth with my cell phone- Nokia Lumia 635.It does not show the visibility of the Anchor in the Lumia Phone bluetooth network. I guess its the problem experienced with Nokia Lumia Phones. But then this problem can be solved via the chords. I have other portable and mini speaker devices as well but none had the bluetooth option, it always had to be connected via the chord. The bluetooth gives you the flexibility to place the speaker anywhere you which and hence giving an awesome effect. Also unlike other Chinese made mini speakers, when tested in high volume, it doesnt screech and the voice also doesnt break. You will be amazed the clear sound that is produced from this mini speaker device. I enjoy using the device while taking a shower. Dont try placing the device in the shower as it is not water proof. Well I am happy with the overall utility as have been using it on a daily basis. Also I am very happy about the pocket size. This is the first time I have used Anchor and very happy. Looking forward for some new Anchor products - achor portable charger",

This speaker works great! It sounds ten times ( subjective measurement) better than the laptop speaker ever did. It is small enough to fit in the pocket of the laptop sleeve with the duck taped apple power cord that is cord # 3. Battery life seems eternal and connected in 1 second via blue tooth. Comes with RCA 3.5mm cable if you don't have or want to use blue tooth and charger cord and a small well constructed pouch. It's not Bose sound but it's perfect for portability,battery life and sound quality is surprisingly good. Mending my review: Spontaneously died and now won't turn on. Less than 1 year life. No trauma to speaker as far as I know on my part--just fizzled out. Editing my amendment: Anker read my comment and then sent me a new speaker. I was really happy about that., They did it with no effort on my part other than reading my review. I have to say, that is a wonderful way to do business. The new speaker works as advertised. Has replaced the blown MacBook Pro speaker. Now if only Apple would acknowledge their chargers, logic boards and speakers don't hold up on a certain series of MacBook Pros Anyways thank you Anker, good sounding speaker, long battery life, very portable, connects via bluetooth in a second, comes with a second cable to hook up directly without bluetooth, and priced right!",

Inside Anker's elegant but simplistic packaging you will find everything necessary to get you started, including usb cables and a nice microfiber faux velvet travel pouch. I found max volume to be less than I would have wished with some minor distortion in the upper bounds, but sound quality is very good for this speaker class. It will most likely exceed most user expectations and may even surprise a few audiophiles. Battery life is excellent as advertised, and pairing with NFC was a breeze. Hope it will last like other Anker products. One side note. I tried setting this on my bathroom counter top to listen to while in the shower. Unfortunately, the volume isn't quiet loud enough to pierce the sound of running water even when just 3 feet away. Also for comparison the Anker A7910 seems to exceed sound quality of AmazonBasics A100s in some ways, though not quite as loud at max volume. It has clearer, less muddled mids and highs, though bass falls flat for both speakers (but that's expected considering the speaker class).",

After posting my review I got an email and I was offered a replacement with the bigger but more fully featured A7908 bluetooth speaker. Pros: Very loud speaker from such a small form factor. I haven't used the NFC feature yet, but like having it available when needed. Cons: There are no volume or skip controls on this speaker. The only button is for the Power on/off. The LED indicator is on the button you are pressing so it is difficult to see it. It does not have a microphone, so using it more than a few feet away from the device it is paired to will not be very effective. Also, you can't use it effectively for phone calls - since it has no microphone and controls to answer or hang up the call. When I used this speaker with IPad connected with the audio jack the volume was very loud and clear, but when I did the same with an Android device and Skype the volume was very low - even though I had set the volume in the device to the highest.",

I think this is my 5th Anker product - three batteries and now two speakers, and I couldn't be more impressed with the build quality and functionality of them. Based on appearance alone, this little speaker should sound muffled, tinny and lacking of bass like most of the other teeny speakers out there, but it doesn't! I used it for the first time in the kitchen last night, and my 12-year-old daughter asked if I was using my UE Mini Boom - another small speaker with great sound. This Anker is half the size of that UE! I can't honestly say it sounds as good, but I'll say it's 80-90% of UE, falling just a little short in the bass department. That being said, I can literally fit this Anker in the pocket of my jeans, and It has plenty of sound to fill up a small to medium sized room. It has nice clean lines - there is no volume control, just a single button that functions as both the on/off and pairing switch, and the bottom is rubberized to keep this little gem in place. While I am not an Anker spokesperson (nor someone who gets their products for free) I can't say enough good things about this speaker (and the other four Anker items I own.",

First off, the sound is good enough to play jazz (REAL jazz..Not \"smooth jazz\" which isn't jazz at all, but I digress!) loud enough to fill up a 35'X25' room. I know this, because that's what this speaker does for me every work day. It's a little weak on the bass, but that's fine; especially for the price you're paying for such a good output. No, you're not going to blow the windows out with this little baby; but it provides great, clear background music for a large room. Secondly, the charge holds up for a very good, long time. I come to work every day at 8:30 a.m (after leaving it charged overnight), and it plays perfectly until I leave work at 3:45. At the end of each workday, I just plug it into a \"charging\" computer that's always on here at work, and leave it alone overnight. The computer is ..hold up...Let me see how far I can take this laptop away before it starts skipping..EXPERIMENTING RIGHT NOW.....Holy crap! I just went across the room, 35 feet away, and nothing changed! I even put it behind a partition, and it just kept belting out Miles Davis!! This is awesome! Search no further. Ok, maybe you want to spend 10 bucks more to get free shipping. Well don't spend it on a speaker; go spend it on something else, because this little baby is awesome.

The Amazon replacement process was easy and fast. My new speaker arrived and worked perfectly. The sound is large for the size and no, you wont feel any thumping bass but the audio is far better than any tablet or phone speaker, and it is almost as loud as my other slightly larger Bluetooth speakers. The long battery life is another plus. I have an Anker recharge battery which I have been using for a couple years now and that is also a quality product. Most defective electronic products are not worth a second chance but I am very pleased with this speaker and am glad I gave it another shot. Order one, you wont be dissapointed.",

There is one tiny issue. If you place the speaker right next to your device's bluetooth antenna, the BT connection will cut in and out rapidly. The issue may also vary with the volume. Solution, move it six inches away. I returned the first one I received because of the issue. However, the second one also did it.

For example, I primarily use this in my vehicle, so i find that by placing it into a cup holder, the sound comes across as being more of a rich, heavenly sound. I have also linked this to the Audio port of my HDTV and have found that it is actually a better external speaker than my actual television. I don't need a Sound Bar, this little guy really fills the room for me and at a MUCH better price.

A few comments: - Cannot use it while charging. - Does not have a volume switch so if your device's lowest volume setting is too loud, you cannot turn it any lower. - The LED is lit blue when connected via bluetooth. If you connect it to a device using an AUX cable, the LED is off, making it easy to forget it is on and to turn if off when not in use. I think these three things are very minor and will not affect most users, just a few things to be aware of so you are not surprised. I use it to listen to streaming radio and podcasts. For this kind of use, the small size does not affect the audio quality. Really like this little speaker. Also, I sent them an email asking about the LED and they got back withing the day and were extremely helpful. 5 stars to their tech support and customer follow-up!",

It is a top notch product from Anker as expected and DELIVERS a crisp, clean balanced sound. It is a PERSONAL speaker, not designed to \"fill a room\" with music but, placed on your desk or nightstand it has plenty of punch. With just 2 controls it is also very SIMPLE to use. There is a micro USB input for charging AND aux input and the ON/OFF button which is also the blue light indicating pairing or operating. Build quality is SOLID, unlike many small speakers. It does ONE thing extremely well: reproduce music or voice with integrity. I use mine on the bedside table for late night podcasts and soothing music. It's about the size of an egg. Volume is controlled completely from your device which I find convenient. I may buy a second one just for the office desk. Its' footprint is just a couple of inches so NOT an intrusion at all. For about $20 you will NOT be sorry!",

The audio quality is exceptional for it's size, it throws a pretty good bump for EDM and rock. Sounds better when on a hard surface, such as a table. It's very good for nights on the patio, conversing or having a smoke session. I would rate it 5 stars, but I only had the device for about 3 weeks before something went wrong. Only one of the speakers inside works unless you press down on the input cord. Not sure how long before it dies completely, but it seems like it will soon. So, $20 sort of wasted. If this is your first Anker product, and something goes wrong with it, I would say give it another chance. I might buy a more high end speaker from them to see if Anker is a company worth buying from again. If not, then it's back to JBL, Jambox, or something of the sort.",

            "review_text": "Unfortunately, this bluetooth speaker did not quite meet my expectations in terms of sound quality based on the high number of positive ratings. When listening at low to moderate volume levels, a static/buzzing noise can easily be heard in a setting such as a small room. This noise is especially accentuated when there are quiet moments in a song. If you are listening more than a few feet away and at a high enough volume (> than about 30% volume) the static noise is not noticable.This speaker was tested with an iphone, and an ipad with the same issue. Anker customer support was extremely helpful in assisting with a replacement, but to my surprise, the second speaker had the exact same problem, leading me to believe that there may be an issue with quality control on Anker's side. I ended up returning the replacement for a full refund. Pros -very well packaged -great build quality -very portable -NFC (for devices that have this) -can get very loud without much distortion -matte texture repels fingerprints -great battery life -exceptional customer service -comes with all cables you need/is ready right out of the box Cons -no microphone -cannot use in line connection and charge at the same time (slightly negated by great battery life) -static/buzzing noise at moderate volume Had it not been for the static noise I would have kept this speaker. However for my needs it was not sufficient. I give this speaker a hesitant recommendation. If you will be in close proximity to the speaker and will only be listening at a low to moderate volume, such as in a bedroom setting, I would suggest searching a little more first. However, If you will be more than a few feet away and have the volume turned up, I would have no qualms about recommending you this speaker as you should not be in range to hear the static noise.",

Frankly, it is not a lot better than the speaker in my iPhone 5S, but it can get much louder and is better enough to use. It has a much less natural sound compared to the Oontz Curve, which is about twice the size and heavier. I returned the Oontz Curve, however, because it is talking ALL the time, when connecting, etc. The Anker speaker just beeps (thank you). I'll keep this little speaker for travel, but for home use I am going to try one of the larger Anker bluetooth speakers.",

I had the speaker on listening to the Reds game at 4 notches below full volume. I walked to the room where my mom was watching TV and I could still clearly hear my speaker. This little guy is incredible. The sound is very good quality. There is even a pretty solid (for the size) bass presence. I think there might be a tiny little woofer in this thing.

With that expectation aside, it's great. Took it to the beach, and it was nice to stream some Dave Mathews for ambiance. In my 22\" carry on, it fits in a shoe, which is GREAT. And it's three ounces.

Absolute value for the money. I would not compare this speaker to some of the high end speakers such as the JBLs and the Bose speaker. This speaker guarantees you the maximum bang for the buck. You cannot get better than this for the sub $25.00 Bluetooth speaker. The bass is very clear without any distortion even at the highest volume.

Believe it or not, my recommendation for the best inexpensive portable speaker for travel (such as hotel rooms etc..) is the AmazonBasics Mini (and not the Nano, which is the small round one).

I purchased this speaker after seeing and hearing a co-worker playing his. I have tried many tiny speakers and nothing comes close to this one. It is very convenient and fits pretty much anywhere. It comes with a nice bag, but you really won't need it. It has a tough exterior so I don't worry about getting it damaged or scratched. It also comes with a micro USB charging cable and a USB to 3.5mm jack to connect to non-bluetooth sources. You want this speaker. If you have been looking for a portable sound that is excellent and not pricey...look no further. The usefulness, volume, battery life, and sound quality make this a no brainer purchase. You won't suffer buyer's remorse.",

It comes with a USB to micro-USB cable for charging AS WELL as a mini-jack (I don't remember if it's 3/8in or 1/8in) to micro-USB cable so that you can connect it to a device that may not have Bluetooth.

The range is amazing too i could walk away 20ft with my phone still no problems . I even went in the bedroom (speaker in the living room ) so about 25ft away with several walls inn the way and still no problems all thought when i moved it around it would cut in and out but if i left my phone still on the table the music would play just fine. The only thing that sucks which isnt a reflextion of the product .just would be nice if you could make calls .or atleast hear the caller through the speeaker.",

I only need to charge it every couple of days and listen to it 8-9 hours a day. I also like that it does not have phone capabilities, per se.

The battery life seems to be good so far. Usually my phone dies first. (Bluetooth) It send to charge up pretty quick too. One thing I don't like is that they do not recommend that you charge the speaker while it is on. Disappointing since I carry external battery packs for reasons like that. Overall, I think for the price, you can't go wrong with this speaker. It is super small and portable and gives out good sound. Throw it in your bag or pocket and you could have a party anywhere.",

Right from opening the box I was impressed with the detail and thought put into it.The packaging was mostly cardboard, and the outside wrapper opened with a simple pull strip. It was completely frustration free packaging. When I opened the lid of the box I was greeted with a \"Thank you for choosing Anker\" message printed on the box. With the instruction pamphlet was a second pamphlet. On one side, it said \"Unhappy? Let us know at....\" and on the other \"Happy? Let us know at...\" (I'm paraphrasing a bit, because I tossed the paperwork a couple of weeks ago.) My overall impression before even using the product was that the company really cared about user experience. I looked at the pictures before I bought it, but it didn't sink how small it is until I held it. It is tiny. I can almost wrap my hand all the way around it, which means it's an easy addition when I'm traveling. It looks really nice, with a very simple design. I also really liked the rubber bottom to help it stay put when you put it down. Using the speaker was really simple. I turned it on, paired it with my phone and started playing music. Because of the small size, I figured it would be pretty quiet. Wrong again. It was actually too loud when I first used it. The volume is controlled by the device it's paired to, which isn't noted in the instructions and took me a minute to figure out. If needed, it can easily fill a 10' x 20' room with sound. (I haven't tried it in a bigger space yet.) The battery life is pretty good, we've been using it an average of a couple hours a day for about 3-4 weeks and I've only charged the battery 2-3 times. I've only noticed two downsides: At high volume, the sound gets a little tinny, but it is a tiny, inexpensive speaker and I pretty much never want it that load anyways. The other issue is when it gets to low battery, a voice comes and says \"Battery Low\" before shutting off. It's really jarring. We been using it to play soft music while our baby sleeps, and the first time that happened, my wife woke up and freaked a little (hearing a strange man's voice in our apartment in the middle of the night). Overall, really impressed with the size, ease of use, battery life, quality, and attention to detail Anker put into their product.",

The speaker itself was a very clean, small cube. So far, so good. I turned it on, paired it to my iPhone (via bluetooth) using the included instructions, and started an audio book through Audible. The sound was good, not great. And then I noticed some type of clipping. When a book is narrated there are natural breaks on the speech, and the speaker was clipping the first few milliseconds of speech after a break...very annoying. This doesn't happen in my car, or with other bluetooth speakers. Might work OK with the accessory cable. Might work OK listening to music, but that's not my expected use.

Walked away from the phone carrying the Anker in my hand for about 40 feet it kept playing without hesitation. Bought this for a travel but I am actually going to use around the house full time. The sound is amazing. Now it's not going to replace your Bose or Beats Bluetooth speakers but you don't want to carry those around anyway. Nice small size to fit in a bag or pocket. Charged for about 45 minutes out of the box and was ready to go. I'm truly impressed!",

If you put the Anker device on a hollow piece of furniture (e.g. a dresser or desk with a drawer underneath the surface), the furniture serves like a subwoofer, improving the bass sound. The one thing that would have been nice to include is a microphone, so that the Anker device could serve as a speakerphone. Their next larger size version does have a microphone.",

What it excels at is clarity. Played low or high, you can hear just about everything in the recording. I use this with my iphone and the connection between the two devices is seamless.

The speaker includes a 1m charging cable, as well as a 1m 3.5mm audio to micro USB if you wish to save your battery and play directly from your phone rather than over Bluetooth. It also works just fine with my laptop and desktop. I mainly listen to classic rock/metal, so I'm not too sure as to how it performs with other genres as I don't have enough experience listening to them, but it works perfectly for the type of music I enjoy! Most definitely worth ever dollar!",

(The main reason I bought it) I didn't realize how small it really was until I opened up the package. The packing material was all high quality and very Apple like in its presentation. This is not a super high fidelity speaker, if that's what you are looking for buy something else.

I often find myself having to turn down my computer's volume because this little dynamo is so powerful. I do wish that I could use this speaker and recharge it at the same time. But for the price and quality of this speaker, this isn't a big deal. Definitely worth purchasing.",

Come with all necessary cables and is able to be connected to other speakers with the 3.5mm cable that comes with it. Nice basic speaker that sounds great and great price too.",

I didn't want to use my 2.1 speakers/sub-woofer system plus it's wires. Sound is superb for the size. The cables included (charger & ext. speaker) work well. Very good product and transaction.

Overall tonality is well into the midrange comparable to Roverbeats T3 but with less low tones. I don't use the word bass with these types of speakers because they lack the capability. Pleasant listening at moderate volume and if you want to mellow the sound a bit, place it on top of a small empty cardboard box. Definitely a keeper.",

If you would want everyone to hear what ur playing, compared to the built in speakers of your phone, this is the way to go.. For its size, the bass is good.. But dont expect for a room filling bass.. Good thing is that it produces the bass you need to hear considering its size.. It just has one button.. The power button.. And only one connection port.. A micro USB port.. For charging and AUX connection.. Yes.. AUX.. Included is a 3.5mm audio jack to micro usb cable.. Not a quite common cable.. So dont lose this.. Overall, this is one quite peculiar thing to have.. Apart from your larger bluetooth speakers.. This is a lot easier to bring along.. I would probably make this a keychain. ;)",

I think using the volume control from your phone would be OK if this was the only Bluetooth speaker you have. This is my third Bluetooth output device after the stereo in my car and the SoundBlaster Roar I use around the house and yard. Those two devices have volume controls, so they like it when I crank my phone. I bought the Anker Ultra Portable Pocket Size Wireless Bluetooth Speaker for my office. In my car my phone is at max volume, and when I connect to the Anker, it blasts in my office until I quickly turn down my phone (and I cannot adjust the Bluetooth volume until it connects and starts playing). Then I get back in my car at the end of the day and try to play music, and it's, like, \"Where's the music? Oh, yeah, I have to turn it back up.\" while negotiating traffic pulling out of the parking lot. Also, with the phone as the only volume control, I would need to really concentrate at my desk, and the song would be recorded really strong, and at volume level 1 on my phone, it was still too loud. A device with volume control would let me better feather off the low volume. And, system sounds from your phone can be startlingly loud. I returned the speaker to get one with volume control.",

I'm very glad it was on sale because I wouldn't have bought it if it was still $40 (due to a lack of cash flow ATM) which would have been a huge shame as this device is exceptional in every way. When holding and viewing this speaker you can tell that it is very high quality due to the materials used and tight manufacturing tolerances involved. When you listen to it you will be staggered at how marvelous it really is. How on earth they fit a speaker, amplifier, Bluetooth and NFC electronics, battery etc in such a tiny device, and with very high quality sound, is just amazing. The sound isn't perfect mind you, it lacks slightly in the treble range due to the fact that it's a mono device and doesn't have that stereo separation (that impacts on the way treble is discerned by the listeners ears), and the bass whilst loud, lacks much oomph or thump, but that's to be expected. But the sound quality far surpasses what you would believe possible in a 1.8\" square cube. It really is astonishing. At $40, this would certainly be a reasonable price as it's quality sound and features and manufacturing standards are very high, but at it's reduced price of $20 it's an absolute must buy. Exceptional value. My only gripe is that you can't buy two and pair both to use in stereo, although you can certainly use a Y-splitter cable to wire up two to create the illusion of stereo (and more volume) to some extent. If money wasn't an issue for me I would certainly have no issue buying this device for $40. It's one of the best buys I've ever bought. Really an exceptional device in a market flooded with absolutely garbage quality speakers. This one will take some serious effort to be beaten. This is \"the\" perfect device for audio lovers who absolutely must listen to music through their smartphone or tablet etc but who have to use headphones due to the poor quality of smartphone speakers. It is loud enough to fill a room. Not for a party mind you, but it's loud enough at full volume for it to be annoyingly loud if you aren't in the mood to have your head blown off. If you are sick of smartphone speakers, annoyed by tangling cables on your headphones, then this is a no-brainer. Even if your phone has front facing speakers like the HTC one series, or has boosted sound output like the 1W LG G3 etc, this device will blow them into the weeds for volume and sound quality. The issues I raised of the slight lack of treble and bass can be largely overcome with a mild bit of equalization. But I need to make it clear that these issues are only relative. As is, it provides great sound quality, and for its size and cost, exceptional sound. I would not hesitate to recommend this device. I should also mention that it's battery life is tremendous given its size, volume output, and constant Bluetooth/NFC connection. You won't regret buying this device.",

            "review_text": "UPDATE: This speaker still awesome, so long as you don't listen to Audio Books. Music will do just fine with this product... but not audio Books. Why? I am not sure, but I think it has to do with Voice Activated Power... whatever one would call it. Regardless of what one calls it the problem is that it cuts out when the speaker stops talking. Well, that sounds fine, you may think, \"I don't want it to waste battery if the speaker / narrator stops talking!\" :) Yes, I agree. But the problem is that it cuts out FAR TOO QUICKLY. Less than a half-second pause, and this thing cuts off. And of course, it cuts right back on a millesecond later. BUT WHEN IT COMES BACK ON, it will always clip a word or half a word. THAT BECOMES VERY ANNOYING. WHen the narrator delivers at even a somewhat slower pace, the cut-out, cut-in process will be through-out your narration, and it will be almost impossible to understand. NORMAL READING SPEED WILL CAUSE THIS TO CUT OFF AND CUT IN. What is it like? Something like this: \"ou may wander what the 5 most exotic animals are. ---r list includes: _ats _ogs _ice _rmadillo _angaroo. \" Every pause at a period, comma, or list will certainly cause this, whether the narrator reads fast or slow. Of course, music doesn't present a problem because there is always music in the backgrounds (or background noise of some kind) while the lyrics are being played. I have to take away 2 stars. I should take away more, since I really use this mostly for AudioBooks now. This seems like a no brainer to fix for the company... but why even release this product like this. Would setting the PAUSE rate to only kick in for a half-selcond pause (this would fix 90% of it) really cause such a drain on battery life? If they set it for a full second, it would almost never be a problem in Audio Books. But set as it is now... say, a quarter second??... and it becomes really bothersome. Oh, to answer the question, \"how do you know it is not your source (Samsung Phone) that is the problem?\" Simple: I turn off the Anker speaker and there is NO cut-in and cut-out that happens. Only when audio goes through this speaker... and only audio books or narrated audio. By the way, when listening to some narrated audio (like a radio news program), I notice that the speaker doesn't cut-in and out. Why? Likely there is an audio background level that keeps the speaker live...even white noise can have a audio level. Audio books will always cause this problem, however. Two star deduction for Audio Book problem. Otherwise, a 5 star little speaker. Here is original review: Check out the size on this amazing little speaker. My battery life has been excellent. I took this 4 hours home, next day was four hours back....left in car overnight. Then two trips on the following two days....we are talking at least 12 hours of use, near full volume in car (until, see below). Great! Third Anker product...all a cut Above what the price would indicate. 5 stars on all. Glad I stumbled on to this gem. About the size of a ping pong ball or golf ball if it were a cube. Rounded edges. Sound doesn't match what it looks like. A few key points: Sound gets better as you place this unit on various objects! I think because of thin rubbery base, it actually gets louder and more full if you place, say, on a desk. Try several places (size makes that easy). I had a ceramic pencil holder with a bell curve...I flipped it over and placed this on it...new sound was impressive for music, not for audiobooks. I place on wood object and again, I could lower volume by a few because of design. Compared to Amazon Echo device: echo has great sound as numerous reviews indicate....but you know what happens when you play your phone audio through echo? (Not that one needs to do often)? Well, it flattens the audio and it is nice and loud but the Echo doesn't handle my galaxy phone audio very well. (Now, compare Echo in Amazons normal play mode ...no Bluetooth connection....well, the Echo stomps this little Anker...but that is to be expected! ) Size matters. Being small has had so many benefits. One is you can place this on many objects to see what sound is best for you. In my Prius, I initially put it in the cup holder. Works well there. But I then stuck it in little tray in dash firing outward. Nice. I tried on the visor...that is good if you want to lower volume cause it is closer to your ears, though you lose something in quality of sound up there. Then I placed on dash...just ok. Then near the visual display at back of dash...bingo! ...sound just was fabulous there. Small size also helps when taking to job or to friends. Listen while charging. Some reviewers say no. It does charge and play at same time (even when battery is drained). However, I had it plugged into a decently powerful car charger (also an Anker purchase) that has that new ability to see what the device needs (so a tablet will get more amps and a flip phone gets much less when charging. I plugged in to the Anker car charger and presto....had good sound again. Wonderful that it has no microphone! Some cars have phone audio (hands free operation] for smartphones...however, many will do the phone fine but not play audiobooks or music from your same smartphone. The Toyota Prius was known for this problem ...it has a great phone interface, but no addition sound from your phone. This anker has no mic, so that is perfect! Bluetooth speakers with phone capabilities are often not as good built in car units. So, if I get a phone call while listening to music on my Anker speaker (through my Samsung phone), well the Prius answers the call. No problem. If you want that mic feature on a Bluetooth speaker ..be sure to order that model. Price? Too good to even question the purchase. Quality? Higher than my older $100 stereo speakers! And much, much better than my Bluetooth Shower speaker (about same price) which was a waste of money compare to this Anker gem. 5 stars.... now 3 stars for audio books hiccup.",

Those speakers are like baseballs. This speaker is like a ping pong ball. Still -- why get this when even Anker itself offers a BIGGER speaker for like $35? Answer One: do you ever listen to music out of your smartphone? And feel like you're in TINNY hell? If you're a lady you can stick this ping pong ball sized speaker in your purse and pull it out when needed. This presumes you're away from your home where better speakers await. If you've managed a lunch outside somewhere and it's quiet enough -- turn on some music and relax. Answer Two: similarly have you ever had your laptop out and about and wished it had better sound? Not killer sound but simply better? Again, this will fit in most laptop bags and yet not weigh it down so much as to consider skipping it. Answer Three: Do you ever go to part of your house you wish had some sort of music? Like a laundry room? The garage? Places where you only visit it now and then and so you don't really need SPEAKER speakers set up? For me it's the bathroom where I shower. There's not enough room for real speakers but this speaker does this trick. And yes it can be heard over the running water. In fact this speaker sounds best in tighter spaces. Or really close to you -- if you were outside and doing some picnic-ing. Providing there's not a ton of noise or music around you. In this way this little speaker is simply amazing. Give it a try!",

            "review_text": "Although I this was my 5th Anker purchase in a little over a month, it was unfortunately the worst. I have 4 other Anker products that perform flawlessly and provide a tremendous value compared to other competitors. I do not like to give 1 star reviews for any products, but unfortunately the main function of this tiny little speaker is flawed - the bluetooth audio quality. The product packaging and quality is top notch and simply cannot be beat for the money. The speaker is small and comes with a charging usb cable and usb-to-3.5mm cable if you decide not to use bluetooth - which I recommend. Upon receiving this product I immediately paired it with my iPhone 6 and it was as simple as can be. The speaker is able to reach a loud volume with ease but I immediately noticed a high level of buzzing and distortion. I know that bluetooth audio is a lossless codec, but this was not the typical sound associated with bluetooth speakers. The sound was dull and lackluster, something that appeared to differ from other Amazon reviews I read before purchasing. The primary reason for my purchase was for a small bluetooth speaker to take to work and have on my workstation for occasionally listening to music and podcasts as time permits. Unfortunately the sound quality via bluetooth was actually worse than the built-in speaker on my iPhone 6. The sound quality is better when utilized with the included usb to 3.5mm cable but that defeats the entire wireless functionality of the device. In recent days I have noticed similar complaints from others users complaining about sound quality and buzzing via bluetooth so I fear that there may be some defective units out there and recommend buying with caution. UPDATE 6-13-15: I have continued to use this speaker occasionally at work and have adjusted my rating accordingly. Although it still does not deliver the sound quality I expected, it works well for podcasts or spoken audio. It has held up nicely after throwing it in my backpack with other objects. For the price and size I guess there must be some trade-offs. I upgraded my score to 3 stars, but more realistically I would give it 2.5.",

            "review_text": "PROs: Tiny speaker with guts...good bluetooth sound. CONs: Only one port on this speaker for both charging and AUX input (micro-USB). The manufacturer fails to explain this in any of the detail description notes or even show a picture of the backside of the device. I was hoping to use this speaker as a low profile PC speaker and just leave it plugged in all the time. That is impossible because of the dual function micro-USB port they engineered into the speaker. You can either 1) plug it into your AUX listening device using the somewhat obscure cable they provide which is micro-USB on one end and 1/8\" stereo plug on the other end, OR 2) you can charge it with the supplied USB to micro-USB cable. I already have the Anker A7908 Portable bluetooth speaker that I use on my desk and was hoping this A7910 Ultra Portable would be of similar construction with both charging and AUX in ports on the back. However, if you intend to use this speaker out and about and charge between uses, I suspect it fills that market point just fine. I just hope you don't expect to listen and charge at the same time if you depend a cable for AUX input. I'm giving it 3 stars because of the lack of detail given on how the single port works for dual functions. If they had been more clear about this from the start, I would have found another solution instead of wasting my time purchasing this one, only to return it.",

            "review_text": "Update: Bumped to 5 stars. Installed an equalizer on my Moto X (2013), and now the music simply sounds better/right to my ears. The stock equalizer/audio effects did nothing for Bluetooth connections, but after installing a 3rd party equalizer that did, the sound is simply wonderful. Turn up the volume, set the equalizer to a standard Rock preset ... and you can feel the bass resonate in my fingers while the treble just sounds right. I still can't say it matches the quality of a much more expensive and larger speaker ... but this thing is more then enough for me. I'm not going to be hunting for another bluetooth speaker after all unless its a G-Boom specifically for heavy bass ... and that isn't happening anytime soon. Pros: Tiny size, long battery life, nice sound, has bass, feels solid, easily portable. Cons: No microphone, no physical buttons beyond power, special micro-usb cable to get Aux Sound in. Well worth the $22 I threw at it when looking for a new speaker. It won't replace surround sound systems or the like, but for something portable? Its great. Original Review First impression: The treble could be better. I'm not an audiophile, in fact I tend to have hearing problems (ear infection as a child), so quality is sometimes lost on me. Still, part of me at first wanted to think that something in the upper frequencies was flat or missing. Further Impressions: I'm keeping it. First, it does get loud filling a room completely with sound and where you may not want to stay near it when its at max volume for long. It hits roughly 90 decibels in volume at max on my phone. It feels solid, as something I won't be worried about getting destroyed easily, but still not something I'd risk spiking into the ground ... but what electronic is? Sound quality wise, it won't match an expensive and larger speaker, of course, but its quite enjoyable. Bass is there even if it doesn't quite have the \"Boom\" I'm used too, but it will cause things nearby to vibrate. Treble as I said in my first impression seems to be missing something, probably the higher frequencies, but acceptable. At max volume, there is no distortion. Size wise? Its tiny. It won't fit in a normal pants pocket, but a coat or cargo pocket will carry this thing easily. Placing it anywhere doesn't take much, due to the small footprint and the fact it won't rattle itself off the shelf or counter. Battery life? Played ambient sound while I was sleeping during the night when I first got it (Thunderstorms), and it was still running when I woke up in the morning on my day off of work ... meaning 10 hours of sleep. REALLY respectable battery life, so don't expect to need to plug it in often unless you are running it day to night to day (even then it only needs an hour and a half to top up). Conclusion: Well worth the money spent. I'm tempted to still buy a UE Mini-Boom or Boom, but I'm keeping this little speaker for other purposes. Its easier to carry around, no worries about getting it stolen or lost (price difference), the battery lasts for a long time, and the sound is quite nice especially for the size. With this, getting a higher quality/expensive bluetooth speaker isn't on my priority list but rather something if a massive discount sale happens. The A7910 definitely is my casual carrying speaker now, and anything else I may buy will probably be geared more towards large bluetooth speakers with a built-in subwoofer for bass at the cost of not being easily carried.",

Was not able to use it for RetroPie via Bluetooth but that is an issue with the distribution not this speaker. With that said however, you can use the nice little 2.5mm to mini-USB audio chord with the Pi's audio jack and it sounds just fine. For anyone using Rasbian or most other distros for the Pi, edit the config.txt file under /boot/config.txt to include: disable_audio_dither=1 This will clean up the generally not great audio output of the Pi and make it sound as it should. This little speaker has a lot more life than I'd figure such a tiny box would have. Awesome and definitely going to keep in mind for future Pi related projects.",

Perhaps this is just a speaker that was missed by Anker's quality control. It's performance is so good, assuming it works, that I'll replace it and see if a new one works. if it does I'll update the review. But I have a lot of external speakers and they've all lasted for years not hours. Updated 4/27/15 - I bought a new Cube. Anker gave me a partial credit. The first one had a defective on-off button. This one works great - so far. The Bluetooth function is remarkable; it works when the speaker and device are as much as 30 feet away. The speaker and my iPod did lose connectivity once, but I was able to reconnect the Cube in less than 30 seconds with a quick trip to the iPod's settings menu. I'll buy a second one and maybe a third. The speaker is so light and sounds so good.",

I bought it as an alternative to my MacBook Pro's (MBP) internal speakers. I blew one of the internal speakers, and since I plan on buying a new MBP in a few months, I didn't see the wisdom in paying to have it fixed. So I decided to get an external speaker. My requirements were that the external speaker had to be very small and inexpensive. This speaker is definitely small, being about 50% larger than a square ice cube. I also like the rubberized outer coating. It looks great and is very comfortable to pick up and move around. Next, I discovered how easy this speaker is to use. It comes with two cables, one for the speaker jack and another for the USB port. I wanted to hear what it sounds like right away so I plugged in the speaker cable. It was definitely much louder than I expected! I had to turn the sound way down on my MBP. Then I decided to try out the bluetooth feature. It paired with my MBP in just a second, and suddenly I had a completely wireless little speaker! The sound is very loud for such a tiny speaker. I used to have to double the sound output on my iTunes TV shows and then have the sound on my MBP set to the loudest possible setting (may be why I eventually blew a speaker?). The sound coming from this little speaker is at least 4x louder. I don't have to double the output on the iTunes TV shows at all; plus, I only have the sound level set to maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of the way up. And even then the sound is much louder than what I was getting using my MBP's speakers. If I turn the sound up a little more, it can fill the entire room so that I can move around and still hear ever word. The sound loudness reminds me of the loudness on a TV set. It's definitely plenty loud! The sound quality is very clear. The base is surprisingly good, as well. It cannot compare to the base on a large stereo, but for the size and price, that's to be expected. Still, the base is good enough to enjoy the sound, including songs played during tv shows. There is no distortion whatsoever. I haven't had to charge it yet. It's been playing for about 18 hours so far (some of that time it's merely turned on, but the MBP went to sleep). I'm waiting for it to tell me to charge it. I expect it will charge simply enough. I love how long the battery's lasting so far. I know I'll get at least the 12 hours advertised once I actually charge it. Overall, this little speaker packs a real punch. If you're looking for a hifi stereo to boom music throughout a large room, this is not the speaker for you. Pay at least 10x the price to get that kind of performance. But if you want a small speaker that's super easy to use with loud and very clear sound, this is the one you want. I'm very happy I got it and recommend it highly!",

So, the small size is incredibly important. My daughter got me a no-name brand inexpensive BT speaker for Christmas, but within 1 month it started playing static under the music almost all the time (that drove me nuts!). I bought this on a whim, knowing that Anker has good products (from my previous purchases) and I could return it if I didn't like it. Wow, was I surprised at the sound that came out of this little speaker. It paired immediately with my phone (and later my laptop when needed), and gave clear, crisp sound (including some bass that I didn't expect). It can get quite loud for my office (thankful that I work in a basement office with no other co-workers to bother). Traveling with this is fantastic! The little bag it comes with keeps it scratch-free, and it's small and light enough to toss into my backpack with my other electronics. Pairing with my laptop for presentations (which include videos) has been wonderful - just used it for a conference in Canada with about 25 people in the room. We ended up using it for everyone's presentation, since there was no sound system in the room and this was loud enough for all to hear! I'm looking forward to traveling around the world with this little guy. In fact, I just had a few partners from Africa here for a visit, and they loved the speaker so much that I bought one for each of them as a gift. For less than $20, this is a great deal for a great bluetooth speaker!!!",

            "review_text": "This is a review of three Anker products that I just purchased, the Ultra Portable Pocket sized Wireless Speaker, the USB 3.0 4-Port Portable Aluminum Hub, and the Aluminum multi-angle Universal Phone and Tablet stand. All three products have that characteristic beautiful Anker packaging with even the wrapping sleeves perfectly creased making the unboxing a delight in the anticipation of quality. Anker doesn't disappoint. The ultra portable speaker is so tiny and a joy to hold in the palm of your hand that my only reaction was, if only they included a storage bag with it. On closer inspection, I realized that, indeed, tucked away in a neat cardboard partition of the insert, there was a very plush micro-fiber pouch which contained a charging cable and a uUSB line in adapter for a wired non-bluetooth connection. Paring of the speaker was effortless by holding down the power button for 2 seconds until the blue LED starts blinking and instantly recognized by my iPhone 6. Wow, was I impressed with the sound and volume from such a tiny package. Did I say I was impressed? 12 hour play time and crystal clear midrange and highs with an edgy sound capable only from a low distortion very rigid driver. Of course the lows were rolled off as to be expected from a 1\" driver, but wasn't that evident because of the clarity and detail remaining in the music. I look forward to trying out this little guy's big brother which has a 4\" driver. For the price and portability (great for travel), this tiny speaker has no peer. I highly recommend it. Next up is the stylish and Apple-esque styled Aluminum USB 3.0 hub. Ergonomics are perfect with wide spacing for the USB ports so that larger cables and devices can comfortably sit in their spots. The 2' cable is a perfect length to get to my monitor mounted Apple mini and sit in a perfectly accessible location on my desk. And with USB 3.0 speeds, what's not to like? Highly recommended. Finally, the Aluminum Multi-Angle Phone and Tablet stand is a joy to behold. It has the same elegantly machined aluminum as the hub and has more than enough latched (button enabled) angle settings for either my iPhone or my iPad mini to rest comfortably and solidly on my desk. Highly recommended. Did I say, I love Anker products?",

Another speaker that I use it is 2.7 inches tall and I love you also may be a little better sound not much but it it it's easier to carry in your pocket check it out also. Elecstars Bluetooth speaker, The CO had a speaker called JBL Clip + or plus it is 4\" tall but it is truly like a theater speaker but it's $40-$50 compared to 20 depends on how wealthy you are. Hope this helps, if interested I have found a Bluetooth radio that is 10\" long rechargeable,you can play all the JW songs and drama it is almost like a bose, truely wonderful sound I also down loaded a equalizer to get true effect, send me a note and I will get you the info",

This speaker works fine and doesn't produce any static, but the sound quality is just OK - a little bit tinny sounding. It could use more base. Maybe there's a way to adjust this in my computer? The problem I had with my other speaker was that the cord was not long enough so when I saw this had blue tooth technology, I thought that solved the problem. However, for some reason the blue tooth keeps disconnecting. It's annoying that I have to keep reconnecting it. So I ended up just using the cord to plug it in to my computer, but I wish the cord was a bit longer. Update: I returned this speaker and Anker contacted me to offer a free replacement. I accepted. I had already gotten a different speaker so I gave it to my husband to use. He said that he connected the blue tooth to his phone and it works great, however when he tried to connect it to his laptop, it could not find it. So I don't know if the problem is with his computer or the speaker. Anyway the customer service is excellent from this company and they really do want to make sure you are happy with your purchase.",

This weird disembodied male voice says \"Battery Low\" out of nowhere and it startles me every time. 2. I use this a lot with the cord since my PC has no wireless capabilities or decent speakers. When powered with the cord there is no way to tell the speaker is on so I've left this speaker on overnight several times by mistake.",

Updated Review: This small speaker still has miserably poor sound. However, I was very pleased that Anker was willing to exchange it for the A7908 which is significantly larger and sounds like a real speaker. The A7908 is bigger than I wanted, but well worth the improved sound quality. Thumbs up to Anker for being proactive at resolving customer satisfaction issues. I've bought quite a few Anker products over the past couple years and they have all been high build quality and as a result I'm pretty confident in recommending the brand itself. (though not this particular pocket size speaker)",

It sounds good for playing jazz or blues music heavy on vocal however would not recommend for pop and rock or alternative. The speakers sound staticky :(. Furthermore the Bluetooth is horrible. I originally bought this to listen to my audiobooks however the Bluetooth does not do good picking up short intervals of sound such as the narrator stoping and speaking. When on Bluetooth the speaker cuts the words' first parts. For example while originally it should read: \"Running around the boy danced\". From the speaker it comes out as \" 'unning 'round the boy 'anced\" however this problem does not occur when plugged into the aux cord. To sum it up: -not good for amplifying pop or rock music (staticky) -good for soft jazz or vocal -not good to use with Bluetooth when listening to audiobooks (music seems to be fine though) -very loud volume -very light however box shape inconvinient to carry around -aesthetically pleasing -battery time .... Eh. It lasts more like 6 hrs than 12. Would I recommend it? No. There are better speakers out there. Keep looking :)",

It's a subtle high-pitched tone that not everyone may be able to distinguish easily, but it makes this speaker pretty much unusable for me. I've emailed Anker and I'll keep everyone posted! Update #1: Anker customer support has been top notch. I received multiple emails asking about the interference and they seem committed to fixing the product. They offered to either exchange it or give me a full refund. +1 star for great customer service! Update #2: I received the replacement unit yesterday and unfortunately it has the same issue. At this point I'm going to assume this is a flaw with the product and not a defect with just the speaker I received.

Go for it!!! So dissapointed. After reading all the good reviews i had no doubt to purchase this portable speaker. It only worked for 1 month .... It stopped charging and the little red ligh or blue light never came back. I plug it and have to have the button pushed then lights up w red light but It Does Not do anything I'm again stucked with another bluetooth speaker in my drawer. I live out of the country so it makes it imposible to return it...... I'm again UNABLE to listen to music on ipad/ipod when I'm busy with my hands and moving around. <<<<I have to add, i wrote AnkerDirect and innmediate agreed to send a replacement for the mini speaker even after returning window had expired.

Look at the Anker Classic Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker, Powerful Sound with Enhanced Bass, 20 Hour Battery Life, and Built-in Mic, works with iPhone, iPad, Samsung, Nexus, HTC, Laptops and More (Black) . It's a little bigger but has a deeper sound and more flexibility. I'll explain. I wanted a speaker to use in the office or at home when going to sleep. Every device I've tried (iphone, ipod, ipad, galaxy s4) plays way too loud on this for either setting. I would turn down to the lowest setting and it would still be really loud. On the apple devices, I would even use my finger on the bottom tray and get the slider half way between zero and the lowest setting. Still too loud. Moved it off my nightstand to the dresser across the room, and it was still quite loud even when competing with the furnace. In the office, I was worried people would come over and complain, especially when louder songs would come on. If this had a volume control and could go a little quieter, it would be an awesome speaker. I ended up putting it in the baby's stroller, and it makes a very cool \"car radio\" kind of setup. Fits in the snap compartment and provides plenty of sound to be heard when walking to the park or on the bike path. It's an impressive speaker if you want a lot of sound in a small package, but overpowering if you don't want that much sound. I do like Anker, their support is great and for the value the bigger speaker is comparable to the UE BOOM Wireless Bluetooth Speaker - Black , or OontZ Angle PLUS Portable Wireless Water Resistant Bluetooth Speaker, (BLACK), by Cambridge SoundWorks [Newer Upgraded Model Available Now: Search Amazon for OontZ Angle 3 ] (also a great speaker) in terms of sound and usefulness.",

I bought 3 of these as gifts for relatives. Overall: Great design, but sound lacks clarity and depth. Pros: > The matte-black design looks great and feel nice to hold. Cons: > Sound sucks (I have another portable bluetooth speaker that's a bit bigger but it sounds a world of a difference). > No lanyard loop so can't tie this to a bookbag or anything else... and since it's so small, easy to lose without a lanyard of some kind > Can't link these up... thought of having a Left and Right channel, but can't do that > No Mic, so can't pick-up calls like my other bluetooth speaker",

            "review_text": "Received as a gift today. Usually, if I even get around to writing a review, it isn't until prompted by Amazon, but this speaker is so cool, I couldn't wait to gush! Plus, the decision to place an order was based on only 14 Amazon reviews, which was a leap of faith, IMO, so I'm here to reassure anyone out there who might be hesitant like me. As far as the instructions go, not much to know before using: 1) power on by holding button down 3sec. 2) control volume with device, in my case my iPhone. 3) already charged out of the box, but when 12 hr charge is used up (voice supposedly annouces low battery) have it powered off while charging to protect the battery. For newbies out there, pairing is simple--and a one-time thing. * Go into Settings on your phone or tablet and turn on Bluetooth. * Have the speaker by your phone and within seconds \"Anker A7910\" appears. Tap on it to connect. * To pair with another device, make sure you've turned off the Bluetooth temporarily on your first device. In my case, pairing would not occur on the iPad until I turned off Bluetooth on the iPhone. The sound quality SHOCKED us. It was so good! I'm not sure what shocked me more, the sound quality or it's tiny size! It was like a double whammy: \"Look how small it is! ... Omg, it sounds great!\" We just bought ourselves a Bluetooth speaker a month ago, Sony SRS-X5, which got great reviews and we are very pleased with it. Then I got on a Bluetooth craze and wanted something small enough to fit in my pocket while walking the dog, etc., so my daughter did the research and this Anker speaker was the tiniest one she could find and figured for $23 it was worth the gamble, especially with an 18 month warranty. As I sit here listening to this Anker, I'm kind of wishing I could return the $130 (on sale) Sony and keep the little guy! Seriously. I can see using this in the house as well and being nearly as satisfied. True, the sound to an audiophile will be better on the Sony, but for my purposes I'd rather be $100 richer! At this time in our lives, when you have just about everything you need, this made the PERFECT gift. New to me or Nice to know: * while listening to music, you will still hear your text msg alerts. * turns itself off after about ten minutes if you turn off your device's Bluetooth, giving an audible beep as it powered off, as it did when powering on, and when it connected. * if you have Bluetooth turned on, on all of your devices, the Anker will automatically connect with the last device it had been connected to previously. * nice rubberized base keeps it secure on tabletop * came with a small sturdy protective pouch, and I could hear the sound just as well through its fabric. Since it'll be carried in my pocket most often, I may just keep it in the pouch all the time. You can feel the power button through the fabric, so turning it on will be a breeze. The only downside so far is not knowing how much battery is left. But that's not a biggie. I might just get into the habit of charging it overnight every night as I found no warning in the instructions to wait until battery fully discharged. P.S. I promise to update if my feelings change, but for now I'm in love! P.P.S. May 2015. Still loving it",

I answered a couple of questions they requested and was sent the speaker. I received it within 1 weeks and let me tell you, for the money, this is one great little speaker! No big frills...no HUGE bass but the clarity and sound it gives is really good and fills the room. When it came to the customer service, it was fantastic!!

It only weighs in a 3.17 ounces but this little speaker can get the job done in playing your music, audio books, videos or your recorded lessons. You can charge this speaker's internal battery in 1 \u00bd to 3 hours and it will provide up to 12 hours of continuous play time with one charge. You can charge it with your computer's USB port, an AC USB wall charger or a vehicle USB charger. It is rated at 5VDC at \u00bd Amp but you can use a higher current like 1 amp. It features Bluetooth 3.0 connection for the wireless transmission of the audio to the speaker and it also has NFC (Near Field Connection) capabilities. Its connection distance is up to 33 feet. It comes with an Auxiliary cable that is 31 inches long, a 32 inch long charging cable, a nice velour carrying bag and an instruction manual. It comes with an Anker 18 month warranty. The speaker produces very good sounds and good volume for its size. It utilizes a 3 watt audio speaker. The speaker does not have a volume control and you adjust the volume output level by using the volume controls of the device you are using to create the sounds. You will see this in my video. Pairing the speaker is fast and easy and I also show how to do that in my video. The speaker does not include a microphone so you have to make your phone calls using your phone. It still is awful cute and it sounds great. The unit can fit into your pocket, purse, backpack or computer bag. It is made to travel and keep you company and supply your entertainment needs while you are on the move. Highly portable, good sound, good warranty and sold at a good price. I gave it a 5 star rating. I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation. A review was not promised to the supplier in exchange for the sample but I stated that if I provided a review that it would be fair and honest.",
