            "review_text": "Lots of good features but I would change some things. I have put about 300 miles on these walking, hiking, and running on a variety of surfaces. The Adidas Kanadia 8 shoe is a good all-arounder. Does everything good but nothing great. Traction is pretty good on road and dirt but is very slick on some wet surfaces like wet rocks and wet wood. The cloud cushioning is very good and is responsive yet dampens. These shoes have good feel on the trail and are not too stiff. Fairly lightweight but still pretty durable. Running on the trail is pretty good. The soles hookup well on dirt and rocky surfaces. However, wet surfaces can be very slippery. Running on road is decent. When running on the road, I kept wanting my road running shoes, however, not many shoes are able to perform well on the trail as well as the road so this isn't really a big issue. The fit is for me was correct in size but a bit narrow in the mid-section. Toebox is roomy. My main issue for the fit was the narrowness and that the lace configuration. To me, there should be more holes for the laces because it was difficult to make the shoe fit comfortably because there isn't enough even pressure of the laces. More holes should solve that. Mid-section support was good but again narrow and I don't have an overly wide foot. Just average width. The toebox material has shown some wear from rubbing. It would be nice to implement some material like the stretchy Nike Flyknit material to the toebox to make the show fit more snugly be a more durable.",

They actually surpassed my expectations since they are so comfortable and solidly constructed. I could walk, hike, run for hours if I was in that kinda shape. Another plus is the strap on the rear of the shoe (not sure what it is called). this helps keep trail pants (I dunno why they make them all like bell bottoms lol) up off the ground if they are wide bottom boot cut. A great value and a great looking pair of kicks.",

So happy to not have to go shoe shopping at the store during the season. These shoes have a nice little heft to them and appear durable enough to withstand teenager shenanigans at least for a few months until he grows again.",
